# Graduate School of Design & Science — Curriculum

This document describes the curriculum for the Graduate School of Design & Science (SDS) at Chiba Institute of Technology, launching April 2026.

---

## Overview

SDS provides both Master's and PhD programs structured around project-based, antidisciplinary learning and impactful research.

Both degree pathways include:
- Coursework combining core and elective classes
- Independent, advisor-guided research with milestone reviews
- Proposal, thesis/dissertation, and defense requirements
- Regular mentoring and committee feedback

## AI Integration Across the Curriculum

Charter Section IV.3 establishes that AI integration is not optional—it is a foundational assumption of all educational programs. In this curriculum, AI is embedded across the program rather than confined to dedicated electives:

- **All courses** assume students have access to powerful AI collaborators. Learning experiences are designed to remain meaningful in this context.
- **APS I and II** require students to develop effective AI workflows, manage sustained AI-assisted projects, and build metacognitive awareness of where AI-assisted work breaks down.
- **Advanced Research sequences** (both Master's and PhD) involve extended AI collaboration, with emphasis on maintaining human judgment, context management across sessions, and security awareness.
- **Intelligent Agents**, **Human and Machine Learning**, and their Advanced counterparts provide dedicated depth for students choosing to specialize, but the core competencies from Charter IV.3—workflow literacy, metacognitive awareness, security and privacy, and assessment of judgment over answer correctness—are developed in the mandatory course sequences.

Assessment across the curriculum distinguishes between human judgment and AI execution, consistent with Charter IV.3's requirement that evaluation focus on problem framing, error identification, and meaningful improvement upon AI-generated work.

## Curriculum Agility

Charter Section IV.3 requires programs to iterate in real-time with advances in AI capability. This curriculum is designed for structured adaptability:

- **Modular structure**: Elective courses can be updated, replaced, or added without disrupting the mandatory core. The Modular Practice Seminar provides a lightweight format for emerging topics.
- **Continuous experimentation**: Faculty are expected to adapt pedagogical approaches within courses as tools and best practices evolve, with mechanisms for sharing what works.
- **Rapid feedback loops**: Project-based assessment in APS and Advanced Research courses provides continuous signal about whether approaches are working, rather than relying solely on end-of-term evaluation.
- **Documented learning**: When curriculum components change, the reasoning and results are captured in the version-controlled Curriculum document, building institutional knowledge.

## Alignment with Charter Principles

The curriculum reflects Charter commitments through both dedicated courses and cross-cutting program design:

- **Antidisciplinarity (Section II.1)**: The DNA course explicitly introduces antidisciplinary thinking. The APS sequence and overall program structure require working across and beyond traditional disciplines.
- **Radical Transformation and Human Flourishing (Section II.2)**: Digital Media & Flourishing directly addresses flourishing as an aim of technology. The APS courses pursue transformation through bounded projects with real-world stakes.
- **Human and Artificial Intelligence (Section II.3)**: Intelligent Agents and Human and Machine Learning address symbiotic human-AI work. AI tools are integrated as a foundational assumption across all courses (see AI Integration above).
- **Complexity and Magic (Section II.4)**: Complex System Science and Modern Physics develop the capacity to work with irreducible complexity and resist premature reduction.
- **Intellectual Integrity (Section II.5)**: Calibrated claims, honest engagement across fields, and proper attribution are embedded in the APS and Advanced Research sequences where students produce original work.
- **Experimentation and Risk (Section II.6)**: The APS courses center on experimentation with real stakes, where failure is expected and valued as a source of learning.
- **Neurodiversity and Inclusion (Section II.7)**: The program's project-based structure, multiple assessment modes, and flexible elective pathways support diverse cognitive styles and learning approaches.
- **Awareness Practices (Section II.8)**: Principles of Awareness integrates contemplative traditions—attention, embodied cognition, and direct experience—as legitimate educational methods.
- **Ethical Grounding (Sections II.5, II.6)**: Law and Governance, Technology and Values, and Engineering Ethics ensure ethical reflection accompanies technical capability across both programs.
- **Project-Centered Learning (Section IV.1)**: The APS courses and Advanced Research sequences center learning on bounded projects with real deliverables, visible outputs, and student agency in project selection.
- **Learning Through Making (Section IV.2)**: Design & Prototyping and the APS sequence embody the vocational orientation and bias toward action, where students produce artifacts that exist in the world.
- **Computational and Agentic Systems (Section IV.3)**: AI integration is embedded across the curriculum (see AI Integration above). Curriculum agility mechanisms ensure the program adapts as AI capabilities evolve (see Curriculum Agility above).
