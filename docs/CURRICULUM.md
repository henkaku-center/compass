## Alignment with Charter Principles

The curriculum reflects several Charter commitments:

- **Project-Centered Learning (Section IV.1)**: The APS courses and Advanced Research sequences center learning on bounded projects with real deliverables
- **Antidisciplinarity (Section II.1)**: The DNA course and overall structure emphasize working across and beyond traditional disciplines
- **Awareness Practices (Section II.7)**: Principles of Awareness integrates contemplative traditions as legitimate educational methods
- **Human and AI Collaboration (Section II.3)**: Intelligent Agents and Human and Machine Learning courses address symbiotic human-AI work
- **Ethical Grounding**: Law and Governance, Technology and Values, and Engineering Ethics ensure ethical reflection accompanies technical capability
