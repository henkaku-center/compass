# Charter

---

## Preamble

<!--
Purpose:
- State the scope and intent of this Charter.
- Specify who this Charter applies to (institutions, affiliates, researchers, collaborators).
- Clarify what this Charter is *not* (e.g., not a legal contract, not a policy manual, not branding).
-->

This Charter articulates the foundational values, governance principles, and operational commitments shared across the Henkaku Center, the Graduate School of Design & Science (SDS), and affiliated programs within Chiba Institute of Technology.

**Scope and Applicability**

This Charter applies to:
- The Henkaku Center for Radical Transformation and its programs
- The Graduate School of Design & Science (SDS)
- Faculty, researchers, staff, and students participating in these organizations
- Visiting researchers, affiliates, and external partners during their engagement with Charter-covered programs

The Charter provides a shared framework for coordination, decision-making, and accountability across these entities. It establishes expectations without prescribing detailed procedures, which are left to implementing organizations.

**What This Charter Is Not**

This Charter is not a legal contract. It does not create enforceable obligations or supersede applicable law, university regulations, or employment agreements.

This Charter is not a policy manual. Operational policies, procedures, and guidelines are developed separately by implementing organizations, consistent with but distinct from this Charter.

This Charter is not branding. While it articulates identity and values, it is a governance document, not a marketing instrument. It is meant to be lived, not displayed.

**Living Document**

This Charter is designed to evolve. It is maintained under version control, with all changes tracked and traceable. The history of its evolution is itself a record of institutional learning and adaptation.

## I. Foundational Orientations

<!--
These conceptual orientations define the guiding ethos of the organizations
covered by this Charter in conceptual space. Each principle represents a
directional orientation along a contested axis—a deliberate choice about what
we prioritize.

These are not absolute rules but preferential tensions. "Resilience over
strength" does not reject strength, but signals that resilience is the primary
optimization target.
-->

**RESILIENCE** over strength.  
強さではなく、しなやかさを持つ。

**SYSTEMS** over objects.  
モノではなく、システムに焦点を合わせる。

**DISOBEDIENCE** over compliance.  
服従ではなく、反抗する。

**PULL** over push.  
「押す」のではなく、「引く」。

**COMPASSES** over maps.  
地図ではなく、良いコンパスを持つ。

**EMERGENCE** over authority.  
専門家ではなく、クラウド（人々）に向かう。

**RISK** over safety.  
安全ではなく、リスクを取る。

**PRACTICE** over theory.  
理論ではなく、実践に基づく。

**LEARNING** over education.  
教育ではなく、学びに焦点を当てる。

**SUSTAINABILITY** over growth.  
拡大ではなく、持続可能性。

**PUBLIC** over individuals.  
個人の利益ではなく、公共的な視点を持つこと。

**MODULAR** over monolithic.
一枚岩ではなく、モジュール型のデザインを意識すること。

---

**Balancing Dichotomies**

Beyond directional orientations, this Charter also embraces productive tensions—qualities that might seem opposed yet must be held together. These dichotomies define the institutional character:

- **Inclusive yet Elite**: Open to diverse participants and perspectives, yet uncompromising on standards of excellence and rigor.

- **Broad yet Deep**: Spanning disciplines and domains, yet pursuing genuine depth rather than superficial coverage.

- **Diverse yet Harmonious**: Welcoming difference and disagreement, yet cultivating coherence and the ability to act together.

- **Calm yet Exciting**: Maintaining groundedness and stability, yet generating energy and momentum.

- **Confident yet Thrilling**: Acting with conviction and clarity, yet remaining open to surprise and the unexpected.

- **Happy yet Aspirational**: Creating environments where people flourish now, yet always reaching toward what could be better.

These are not compromises or midpoints. They are both/and commitments—holding apparent opposites in creative tension rather than collapsing into either pole.

## II. Values and Commitments

### 1. Antidisciplinarity

<!--
Define antidisciplinarity.
Clarify how it differs from interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity.
Explain when disciplinary rigor is required and when it is intentionally suspended.
-->

Antidisciplinarity describes work that operates outside and between established academic disciplines—not by combining disciplines, but by refusing to be constrained by disciplinary boundaries in the first place.

**Distinction from Related Approaches**

- **Interdisciplinary** work combines insights from multiple established disciplines to address a shared problem. The disciplines remain intact; collaboration happens at their intersection.

- **Transdisciplinary** work transcends disciplinary boundaries by creating new integrative frameworks that subsume contributing disciplines.

- **Antidisciplinary** work begins from problems rather than disciplines. It asks: what does this situation require? The answer may draw on disciplinary knowledge, but disciplinary identity does not determine what questions can be asked or what methods are legitimate.

Antidisciplinarity is not anti-discipline. Disciplinary rigor remains valuable—deep expertise, proven methods, accumulated knowledge. But disciplines are tools, not identities. When a problem demands approaches that no discipline owns, antidisciplinary work fills the gap.

**When Disciplinary Rigor Applies**

Disciplinary standards apply when work makes claims within a discipline's domain. A statistical analysis must meet statistical standards; an engineering design must meet engineering standards. Antidisciplinarity does not excuse poor execution.

What antidisciplinarity permits is the combination of elements that disciplinary gatekeepers might reject as "not our field," the pursuit of questions that fall between disciplines, and the creation of new approaches that no existing discipline would recognize as its own.

**The Antidisciplinary Space**

The most important problems often live in the white space between disciplines—too applied for theoretical fields, too speculative for applied fields, too technical for humanities, too humanistic for engineering. This is where antidisciplinary work operates: not against disciplines, but in the spaces they leave unoccupied.

### 2. Radical Transformation

<!--
Define "radical transformation" as structural, not cosmetic, change.
Clarify the difference between incremental improvement and transformation at the level of systems, institutions, and coordination mechanisms.
State that radical transformation is pursued deliberately, cautiously, and with awareness of second-order effects.
-->

**Human Flourishing as the Aim**

The purpose of transformation is not change for its own sake, but the cultivation of conditions under which humans can flourish. This Charter commits to an understanding of flourishing that encompasses—but extends beyond—productivity, efficiency, and skill acquisition.

Flourishing includes the development of capacities for meaning-making, ethical judgment, creative expression, and genuine connection with others. Educational and research programs covered by this Charter aim not merely to produce competent practitioners, but to cultivate people who can live well, contribute meaningfully, and help others do the same.

This framing has practical implications: when evaluating programs, projects, and institutional decisions, the question is not only "does this work?" but "does this contribute to the flourishing of those involved and affected?" Transformation that optimizes narrow metrics while undermining wellbeing, relationships, or meaning is not radical transformation—it is misdirection.

### 3. Human and Artificial Intelligence

<!--
This section establishes how human and artificial intelligence interact
within the scope of this Charter.

Key principles to articulate here:

- Artificial intelligence systems do not possess moral, legal, or institutional agency.
  They may act within defined workflows, but they do not bear responsibility or authority.
- Human agency may be amplified through computational and agentic systems,
  but it may not be transferred or abdicated.
- Every decision, action, or outcome produced with the assistance of AI
  must have a clear and identifiable line of human accountability.
- Agentic workflows are treated as designed coordination systems,
  including their interfaces, constraints, feedback loops, and escalation paths.
- As system autonomy increases, requirements for oversight, legibility,
  auditability, and intervention increase proportionally.

Ambiguity of responsibility in human–machine systems is considered a
design failure and must be addressed through governance, tooling, or process.
-->

This Charter establishes principles for how human and artificial intelligence interact within the ecosystem.

**AI Systems Do Not Bear Agency**

Artificial intelligence systems—including large language models, autonomous agents, and AI-assisted workflows—do not possess moral, legal, or institutional agency. They may act within defined parameters, generate outputs, and operate with significant autonomy, but they do not bear responsibility. They cannot be accountable. They are not members of our community in the way humans are.

This is not a statement about AI capabilities, which continue to evolve. It is a statement about the structure of responsibility. Regardless of how capable AI systems become, this Charter maintains that accountability remains with humans.

**Human Agency: Amplified but Not Transferred**

AI systems may amplify human agency—extending reach, accelerating work, enabling capabilities that would otherwise be impossible. This amplification is welcomed and encouraged.

However, human agency may not be transferred to AI systems or abdicated through their use. "The AI decided" is not an acceptable explanation. "The AI did it" is not an acceptable assignment of responsibility. Humans who deploy AI systems remain accountable for the outcomes those systems produce.

**Clear Lines of Accountability**

Every decision, action, or outcome produced with AI assistance must have a clear and identifiable line of human accountability. This means:

- Someone specific is responsible for the decision to use AI in a given context
- Someone specific is responsible for reviewing and approving AI-generated outputs before they take effect
- Someone specific is responsible for the consequences when AI-assisted work causes harm

When these lines of accountability are unclear, that ambiguity is a design failure requiring correction through governance, tooling, or process.

**Agentic Workflows as Designed Systems**

Agentic workflows—systems where AI operates with significant autonomy—are treated as designed coordination systems. They require explicit attention to:

- Interfaces: How humans interact with and direct the system
- Constraints: What the system is and is not permitted to do
- Feedback loops: How the system's performance is monitored and corrected
- Escalation paths: When and how the system hands off to human judgment

As system autonomy increases, requirements for oversight, legibility, auditability, and intervention capacity increase proportionally. More autonomous systems require more robust human oversight, not less.

### 4. Intellectual Integrity

<!--
Commitments to truth-seeking, clarity, and rigor.
Distinguish speculation, research, and deployment.
-->

**Resisting Reduction**

The world is complex, and this Charter resists the impulse to reduce that complexity to easy answers or suspiciously straightforward solutions. Problems worth solving are rarely simple; they are interconnected, context-dependent, and adaptive to changing conditions.

Resisting reduction means:

- **Embracing nuance**: Acknowledging ambiguity, variation, and contested interpretations rather than flattening them into false clarity. When reality is messy, our representations of it should preserve that messiness rather than pretend it away.

- **Questioning quantification**: The tendency to treat everything as countable—and therefore monetizable or optimizable—comes from industrial-era thinking that renders reality into ones and zeroes. Not everything that matters can be measured, and not everything that can be measured matters. Numbers are tools, not truths.

- **Holding multiple frames**: Complex situations often require multiple explanatory frameworks that cannot be fully reconciled. Intellectual integrity means being able to work within a frame while remaining aware of its limitations and the validity of alternative perspectives.

- **Resisting premature closure**: The pressure to have answers, make decisions, and move on often leads to conclusions that foreclose better understanding. Staying with uncertainty longer than is comfortable often produces better outcomes than rushing to resolution.

This is not an argument against clarity or decisiveness. Resisting reduction is compatible with taking action under uncertainty—it simply requires honesty about what we don't know and humility about the limits of our models.

**Valuing What Escapes Measurement**

"If you can measure it, it probably isn't magic."

The most significant outcomes—transformation, insight, connection, meaning—often resist quantification. This is not a failure of measurement but a feature of what makes them significant. Work that can be fully captured in metrics is, almost by definition, work that operates within existing frameworks rather than transcending them.

This principle complements rather than contradicts the commitment to measurability elsewhere in this Charter. Projects should articulate how outcomes will be evaluated, and accountability requires evidence. But:

- **Metrics are proxies**: They point toward what matters; they are not themselves what matters. Optimizing metrics while losing sight of underlying goals is a common failure mode.

- **Transformative work creates new categories**: The most important outcomes may not be measurable in advance because the frameworks for understanding them don't yet exist. Genuine innovation changes what counts, not just how much.

- **Presence of magic is a positive signal**: When work produces effects that participants struggle to articulate—when it feels meaningful in ways that resist explanation—that difficulty is evidence of depth, not vagueness.

- **Beware metric fixation**: Systems that optimize only what can be measured tend to produce measurable but hollow outcomes. The unmeasurable dimensions often carry the real value.

This is not an excuse for vagueness or an argument against rigor. It is a reminder that intellectual integrity includes honesty about the limits of our instruments, and that some of the most important things we do will be recognized by their resonance rather than their metrics.

### 5. Experimentation and Risk

<!--
Legitimacy of experimentation and failure.
Boundaries on experimentation involving people, institutions, or public trust.
-->

Experimentation is legitimate and necessary. Progress requires trying things that might not work, and learning from both success and failure.

**The Legitimacy of Failure**

Failure is not merely tolerated—it is expected and valued as a source of learning. Projects that never fail are probably not taking sufficient risks. An environment where failure is punished is an environment where experimentation cannot thrive.

This does not mean all failures are equal. Failures that generate learning are valuable. Failures that result from carelessness, ignored warnings, or repeated mistakes are not. The question is not "did this work?" but "did we learn, and are we applying what we learned?"

**Boundaries on Experimentation**

The legitimacy of experimentation does not override responsibilities to:

- **People**: Experiments involving human participants require appropriate consent, ethical review, and protection from harm. "Move fast and break things" does not apply when the things being broken are people's lives, livelihoods, or dignity.

- **Institutions**: Experiments that put institutional reputation, legal standing, or relationships at risk require appropriate authorization. Individual researchers do not have unlimited license to commit institutional resources or credibility.

- **Public trust**: Work that could undermine public trust in research, education, or the institutions involved requires particular care. Trust, once lost, is difficult to rebuild.

- **Irreversibility**: Experiments with irreversible consequences—environmental, social, or otherwise—require higher standards of justification and review than reversible ones.

**Risk as Orientation**

"Risk over safety" as a foundational orientation means that excessive caution is also a failure mode. Refusing to act without certainty, demanding proof before experimentation, or optimizing for avoiding criticism rather than pursuing impact—these are failures of a different kind.

The goal is appropriate risk: proportionate to potential benefit, bounded by ethical constraints, and taken with clear accountability for outcomes.

### 6. Cultural and Contextual Respect

<!--
Role of Japanese cultural context as a constraint and resource.
Approach to global collaboration without cultural flattening.
-->

**Neurodiversity and Cognitive Difference**

This Charter explicitly acknowledges and respects **neurodiversity**—the natural variation in human cognition, perception, and interaction. We recognize that people think, feel, learn, and collaborate in fundamentally different ways, and that these differences are sources of strength rather than deficits to be corrected.

Respect for neurodiversity means:

- **Valuing different modes of thinking**: Analytical, intuitive, visual, verbal, linear, associative—different cognitive styles contribute different capabilities. Environments and processes should not implicitly privilege one mode over others.

- **Accommodating different modes of feeling**: Emotional expression, sensory sensitivity, and social energy vary widely. Expectations around interaction, presence, and communication should allow for this variation rather than enforcing a single norm.

- **Supporting different modes of collaborating**: Some people thrive in spontaneous discussion; others need time to process before contributing. Some prefer written communication; others prefer verbal. Collaboration structures should create multiple pathways for meaningful participation.

- **Designing for flexibility**: Physical spaces, meeting formats, communication channels, and work rhythms should be designed with variation in mind—not as afterthought accommodations, but as fundamental assumptions.

- **Making the implicit explicit**: Many people—particularly those on the autism spectrum—thrive when expectations, norms, and "rules of the game" are stated directly rather than left to inference. Environments that require participants to guess at unstated expectations, read between the lines, or navigate unspoken social dynamics create unnecessary barriers. Clear communication about what is expected, what is valued, and how decisions are made benefits everyone and is essential for some.

This commitment extends beyond formal disability accommodation. It reflects a recognition that the full range of human cognitive diversity—including but not limited to autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and other neurological differences—brings perspectives and capabilities that homogeneous environments cannot produce. Explicit norms and direct communication are not merely accommodations—they are better design.

**Awareness Practices and Contemplative Traditions**

Japanese cultural context offers distinctive resources for understanding the relationship between awareness, craft, and human development. Traditions of contemplative practice—including but not limited to tea ceremony, calligraphy, and martial arts—embody ways of knowing that complement analytical and technical approaches.

These traditions emphasize:

- **Direct experience**: Understanding that emerges from practice and presence, not only from abstraction and analysis
- **Attention and sensitivity**: The cultivation of refined perception as a foundation for good judgment and skilled action
- **Integration of body and mind**: Recognition that cognition is embodied, and that physical practice shapes mental capability
- **Process as content**: The insight that how something is done matters as much as what is accomplished

As technical work increasingly involves shaping AI behavior and communicating intent rather than writing explicit instructions, these capacities become not merely cultural enrichment but practical requirements. The ability to perceive subtle patterns, maintain sustained attention, and act with sensitivity to context are technical skills for the AI era.

Programs covered by this Charter are encouraged to integrate awareness practices into education and research—not as mandatory spiritual exercises, but as legitimate methods for developing capacities that conventional curricula often neglect.

### 7. Openness with Discernment

<!--
When openness and transparency are required.
When discretion or confidentiality is necessary.
Tradeoffs between transparency and potential harm.
-->

Openness is a default, not an absolute. Transparency supports accountability, collaboration, and trust. But openness requires judgment about what to share, when, and with whom.

**When Openness Is Required**

Transparency is expected for:

- **Governance decisions**: How decisions are made, who participated, and what reasoning led to outcomes. People affected by decisions deserve to understand them.

- **Research methodology**: How work was conducted, what data was used, what limitations exist. Reproducibility and critique require methodological transparency.

- **Conflicts of interest**: Relationships, funding sources, or other factors that might influence judgment. Disclosure enables appropriate interpretation.

- **Institutional commitments**: What this Charter commits to, how it is being implemented, and how progress is being evaluated. Accountability requires visibility.

**When Discretion Is Necessary**

Confidentiality is appropriate for:

- **Personal information**: Privacy is a right. Information about individuals is shared only with consent or legitimate necessity.

- **Developing work**: Ideas in formation may need protected space before public exposure. Premature disclosure can distort or foreclose creative development.

- **Sensitive partnerships**: Some collaborations involve confidential information from partners. Honoring these commitments is a matter of integrity.

- **Security concerns**: Information that could enable harm if disclosed—security vulnerabilities, personal safety information, or similar—requires protection.

**Navigating Tensions**

When transparency and confidentiality conflict, the resolution depends on:

- Who could be helped or harmed by disclosure
- What legitimate interests support confidentiality
- Whether partial disclosure or delayed disclosure could satisfy both concerns
- Who has standing to make the decision

The goal is thoughtful openness—sharing by default, protecting when necessary, and being transparent about the boundaries of transparency itself.

### 8. Human Primacy and Responsibility

<!--
Assert that authority, accountability, and legitimacy are irreducibly human.
Clarify roles of individuals vs institutions.
Explicitly state limits on delegation to computational or automated systems.
-->

Authority, accountability, and legitimacy are irreducibly human. This is not merely a preference but a structural commitment that shapes how this ecosystem operates.

**Authority Remains Human**

Decisions that affect people's lives, work, and futures must be made by humans who can be held accountable for those decisions. Authority may be delegated from one human to another, but it cannot be delegated to systems—computational, procedural, or otherwise—in ways that remove human judgment from consequential choices.

This does not prohibit automation or AI assistance. It requires that a human remains in the loop for decisions that matter, with genuine authority to override, modify, or reject automated recommendations.

**Accountability Cannot Be Distributed Away**

When something goes wrong, there must be a human who is responsible. Accountability cannot be diffused across committees, processes, or technologies until no one is responsible. "The system did it" and "the committee decided" are not acceptable final answers.

Institutions bear collective responsibility, but institutions act through individuals. Identifying which individuals bear accountability for which decisions is a requirement, not an obstacle to collaborative work.

**Legitimacy Through Human Judgment**

Legitimacy—the recognition that an action or decision is rightful—flows from human judgment exercised through appropriate processes. Algorithmic outputs, however sophisticated, do not confer legitimacy. A decision is not legitimate because an AI recommended it; it is legitimate because a human with appropriate authority made it, for defensible reasons, through a recognized process.

**Limits on Delegation**

Certain functions may not be delegated to automated systems without human oversight:

- Decisions affecting individuals' standing, evaluation, or continuation in programs
- Commitments that bind the institution to external parties
- Responses to situations involving safety, ethics, or significant uncertainty
- Interpretations of this Charter or other governance documents

Automation may inform these decisions but may not make them. The human in the loop must have genuine understanding and genuine authority, not merely nominal sign-off on predetermined outcomes.

### 9. Coordination as a Design Problem

<!--
Frame coordination as a first-order object of inquiry.
Explain why institutions, processes, and incentives must be designed.
Identify common coordination failure modes this ecosystem seeks to avoid.
-->

Coordination—how groups align, make decisions, and work together—is not a background condition to be assumed. It is a first-order object of inquiry and a domain requiring explicit design.

**Coordination Does Not Happen Automatically**

Groups do not naturally coordinate well. Without deliberate attention, organizations drift toward dysfunction: misaligned incentives, unclear authority, duplicated effort, unresolved conflicts, and decisions that no one owns. Good coordination requires conscious design of institutions, processes, and incentive structures.

This Charter treats coordination as a design problem equivalent in importance to the substantive work being coordinated. How we work together is as important as what we work on.

**Institutions, Processes, and Incentives Must Be Designed**

- **Institutions**: The structures through which work happens—organizations, roles, relationships—should be intentionally designed, not merely inherited or allowed to emerge. When institutional structures don't serve their purpose, they should be changed.

- **Processes**: How decisions are made, how information flows, how conflicts are resolved—these processes shape outcomes and should be designed for the outcomes we want. Default processes often serve no one well.

- **Incentives**: What behaviors are rewarded, recognized, and promoted shapes what behaviors occur. Incentive structures should be examined for alignment with stated values, and adjusted when misaligned.

**Coordination Failure Modes to Avoid**

This ecosystem seeks to design against common coordination failures:

- **Diffusion of responsibility**: When everyone is responsible, no one is. Clear accountability assignments prevent work from falling through cracks.

- **Information silos**: When parts of the organization don't know what other parts are doing, redundancy and incoherence result. Visibility and communication structures matter.

- **Misaligned incentives**: When individual incentives conflict with collective goals, individuals rationally pursue outcomes that harm the whole. Incentive design is governance design.

- **Decision paralysis**: When decision rights are unclear or processes are too heavy, decisions don't get made. Speed and clarity require intentional design.

- **Informal power structures**: When formal structures don't match how decisions actually get made, accountability becomes impossible and legitimacy erodes. Formal and informal should align.

Coordination is never finished. It requires ongoing attention, evaluation, and adjustment as circumstances change.

## III. Research Practice

### 1. Project-Centered Inquiry

<!--
Define projects as the unit of research inquiry.
Criteria for a legitimate research project.
Project lifecycle: initiation, evolution, completion, and archival.
Relationship between research projects and academic outputs.
-->

**Data Humanism**

Research covered by this Charter adopts a humanistic approach to data—recognizing that data is always shaped by human hands, carrying the fingerprints and biases of its creators. Despite appearances of objectivity, data is physical material formed by human agency. The hand of its creator is always present.

This perspective has practical implications:

- **Context matters**: The relationships and circumstances *between* data points are often more important than the points themselves. This "warm data"—the context, the story, the human situation—is rarely captured in standard visualizations but is fundamental to understanding causality and meaning.

- **Collection is interpretation**: How data is gathered, categorized, and cleaned involves countless decisions that shape what can later be seen. Acknowledging this does not undermine data's value; it makes interpretation more honest.

- **Representation is rhetorical**: Charts, graphs, and dashboards are not neutral windows onto reality. They are arguments, crafted by people with perspectives. Reading data visualizations critically—asking who made this, what choices were made, what is not shown—is a research skill.

- **Qualitative and quantitative are complementary**: Numbers without narrative are incomplete; narrative without evidence is speculation. Good research moves between modes, using each to check and enrich the other.

Data humanism does not reject quantification—it refuses to let quantification obscure the human realities it attempts to represent. The goal is not less data but more honest engagement with what data can and cannot tell us.

**Uniqueness as Selection Criterion**

"If someone else can do it, we shouldn't do it."

This principle guides what work this ecosystem pursues. Given finite resources and attention, projects should be selected not merely for importance but for *fit*—work that this particular combination of people, institutions, and capabilities is uniquely positioned to accomplish.

This means:

- **Comparative advantage**: Prioritize work where our specific strengths—antidisciplinary orientation, cultural context, institutional flexibility, network position—create distinctive value that others cannot easily replicate.

- **Avoid redundancy**: Before launching initiatives, ask whether capable others are already doing this work well. If so, consider collaboration, support, or complementary positioning rather than duplication.

- **Embrace the gaps**: The most important work is often what falls between established categories—too applied for academia, too speculative for industry, too cross-cutting for any single discipline. This is where antidisciplinary institutions can contribute most.

- **Accept opportunity cost**: Saying yes to one project means saying no to others. Uniqueness as a criterion helps ensure that the work we do take on is work that wouldn't happen without us.

This is not an argument for obscurity or contrarianism. Important problems deserve attention from many actors. But within the space of important problems, this ecosystem should gravitate toward those where its contribution is irreplaceable.

### 2. Project Registry and Coordination Infrastructure

Organizations covered by this Charter must establish and maintain a **project registry**—a shared platform for defining, submitting, and browsing active projects and initiatives.

The registry serves as coordination infrastructure, making work visible and enabling participants to identify connections, gaps, and conflicts across the ecosystem.

**Projects as Bounded Units of Transformation**: Projects are distinguished from open-ended research programs or permanent organizational functions by their finite, mission-driven nature. Every project must articulate not only what it aims to achieve, but also what would make it complete.

#### Requirements

**Project Definition Template**: Each project submission must articulate:

- **Intent**: What specific situation, breakdown, or opportunity this project addresses, what transformation is being pursued, and why. This includes both the motivating problem and the intended outcome.

- **Scope**: Boundaries of the project—what it includes and excludes, what it will build or measure or change, and what outputs it will produce. Clear scope prevents indefinite expansion and enables evaluation of completeness.

- **Temporal Bounds**: When the project begins, when it is expected to complete, and key milestones along the way. Projects must be time-bounded to maintain focus and accountability.

- **Measurability and Completion**: How impact or progress will be assessed (whether qualitatively or quantitatively), and what specific evidence would indicate success or failure. Projects must also state what would make the work complete—not just successful, but done.

- **Participants**: Who has authority, accountability, and contribution roles. This includes project ownership (who is responsible for delivery) and contributors (who supports the work and in what capacity).

- **Dependencies**: What this project requires from other efforts, and what other efforts depend on this project. Dependencies make coordination visible and help identify critical paths and bottlenecks.

- **Status**: Current state (proposed, active, paused, completed, archived). Status enables tracking project progression through its lifecycle.

- **Resources** (where applicable): Funding sources, resource allocation, and budgeted areas. Financial and material accountability supports transparency and coordination.

**Measurability with Forgiveness**: Projects must articulate how outcomes will be evaluated, but the Charter recognizes that some impacts—especially systemic, cultural, or long-term transformations—resist clean measurement.

Projects should state *what would count as evidence of success or failure*, even if that evidence cannot be fully quantified. Unmeasurable does not mean unevaluable. Qualitative assessment, stakeholder feedback, and narrative evaluation are legitimate forms of measurement.

**Overlap and Coherence Analysis**: The platform must support participants in:
- Identifying **overlapping scope** between projects (potential redundancy or collaboration opportunity)
- Recognizing **distinctiveness** (how projects differ in approach, method, or aim)
- Surfacing **incoherence** (where projects pursue conflicting goals or undermine each other)

This analysis may be manual, computational, or hybrid, but it must be legible and actionable.

#### Governance

- The registry is a **coordination tool**, not an approval mechanism. Projects do not require permission to be listed, but listing signals accountability to Charter principles.
- The registry does not replace formal institutional processes (course approvals, research ethics review, funding applications). It complements them.
- Projects that violate Charter principles may be flagged for review, but the registry itself does not have enforcement authority.

#### Implementation

- The platform must be accessible to all participants covered by this Charter.
- The template may evolve through governance processes (Section VI), but changes must preserve backward compatibility or provide migration paths for existing entries.
- The platform should lower barriers to entry while maintaining clarity—favoring lightweight initial submissions that can be refined over time.
- Implementations should provide guidance and prompts that help project authors meet these requirements without imposing unnecessary bureaucracy.

## IV. Educational Practice

### 1. Project-Centered Learning

<!--
Define projects as the unit of learning and pedagogy.
Criteria for a legitimate educational project.
Relationship between learning projects and academic assessment.
Student agency and ownership in project selection and execution.
-->

Projects are the fundamental unit of learning in programs covered by this Charter. Students learn not primarily through courses, lectures, or readings, but through engagement with bounded projects that produce real outcomes.

**What Makes a Legitimate Educational Project**

Educational projects share characteristics with research projects (see Section III) but are oriented toward learning rather than contribution to knowledge:

- **Bounded scope**: Projects have clear boundaries—what is included, what is excluded, and what completion looks like. Open-ended exploration is valuable but must eventually crystallize into bounded work.

- **Real stakes**: Projects should matter beyond the classroom. This might mean external audiences, real users, actual implementation, or genuine uncertainty about outcomes. Simulated projects with predetermined answers teach less than projects where results are not known in advance.

- **Appropriate challenge**: Projects should be difficult enough to require growth but achievable enough to permit success. Calibrating this challenge to student capability is a core faculty responsibility.

- **Visible output**: Projects produce artifacts—prototypes, systems, documents, interventions, performances—that can be shared, evaluated, and built upon. Learning is demonstrated through production.

**Student Agency and Ownership**

Students should have meaningful agency in project selection and execution:

- **Selection**: Where possible, students should choose or significantly shape their projects based on their interests, capabilities, and learning goals. Imposed projects may be necessary for foundational skills but should not dominate.

- **Direction**: Within projects, students should make real decisions—not merely execute faculty-determined plans. Learning to make good decisions requires practice making decisions.

- **Ownership**: Students should feel genuine ownership of their work. Projects that feel like assignments to complete for grades produce different learning than projects that feel like the student's own.

**Relationship to Assessment**

Assessment in project-centered learning evaluates:

- The quality of the project output
- The judgment demonstrated in project decisions
- The learning evidenced through the process
- The growth from where the student started

Traditional metrics—exams, grades, credit hours—may be necessary for institutional compatibility but should not drive pedagogy. The question is not "what grade did this earn?" but "what did the student learn, and how is that learning demonstrated?"

### 2. Learning Through Making and Doing

<!--
Role of prototypes, artifacts, simulations, and interventions in education.
Expectation of reflection, documentation, and learning capture.
Integration of theory and practice in project-based learning.
-->

**Vocational Orientation**

This Charter affirms a vocational orientation: the commitment to building things, not merely theorizing about them. Students and researchers are expected to produce artifacts—prototypes, systems, interventions, works—that exist in the world and can be evaluated against reality, not only against abstract criteria.

This orientation does not diminish theory; it insists that theory be tested through practice. The goal is not anti-intellectualism but a refusal to let intellectual work become detached from consequence. Ideas that cannot survive contact with implementation are incomplete.

**Bias Toward Action**

Impact is the art of getting things done. This Charter values tangible outcomes over process theater, shipped work over endless planning, and learning through doing over learning through discussion alone.

A bias toward action means:

- **Default to trying**: When uncertain whether something will work, try it. Small experiments teach more than extended deliberation. Failure is information; paralysis is not.

- **Finish things**: Starting is easy; finishing is hard. The discipline of completing work—pushing through the difficult final stages, making hard decisions, accepting imperfection—is itself a core competency.

- **Reduce time to feedback**: The faster work reaches reality, the faster learning happens. Tight feedback loops between intention and outcome are more valuable than elaborate upfront planning.

- **Distinguish motion from progress**: Activity is not accomplishment. Meetings, documents, and discussions are means, not ends. The question is always: what changed in the world?

This is not an argument against reflection, planning, or careful thought. It is an argument against using those activities as substitutes for action, or as ways to avoid the vulnerability of putting work into the world where it can be judged.

**Unity of Function and Design**

Pursuing design excellence directly improves performance. Aesthetics and function are not separate concerns to be traded off against each other, but deeply intertwined aspects of good work. This principle rejects the assumption that something must be ugly to be functional, or that beauty is a luxury applied after engineering problems are solved.

In practice, this means:

- Design decisions are engineering decisions, and engineering decisions are design decisions
- How something looks, feels, and communicates is inseparable from how well it works
- Attention to craft and finish is not indulgence but discipline
- The pursuit of elegance often reveals simpler, better solutions

Students learn to integrate design thinking with technical implementation from the beginning, not as a separate phase or specialty.

**Process as Content**

The unique identity of a work is expressed not only through what it is, but through how it was made. Process is not merely a means to an end—it is itself content, carrying meaning and value independent of the final artifact.

This principle draws from craft traditions where the maker's presence remains visible in the work:

- **Indexical traces**: The evidence of human hands—brush strokes, tool marks, variations in rhythm—conveys authenticity and care that machine-perfect uniformity cannot. These traces are not flaws to be eliminated but signatures to be valued.

- **Visible repair**: The Japanese tradition of kintsugi—repairing broken pottery with gold—exemplifies how damage and restoration can become part of an object's beauty and meaning. Work that shows its history, including its failures and repairs, tells a richer story than work that hides its past.

- **Tacit knowledge transmission**: Some knowledge cannot be fully articulated in words or diagrams; it must be transmitted through practice, demonstration, and apprenticeship. Making things together is a way of sharing understanding that documentation alone cannot capture.

- **Process-intensive learning**: Students learn not just by producing outputs but by engaging in processes—iteration, revision, collaboration, failure, repair. The discipline of sustained making develops capacities that no amount of reading or discussion can substitute.

In educational contexts, this means valuing works-in-progress, documenting process alongside product, and creating space for the slow development of craft. In research contexts, it means treating methodology as substantive intellectual contribution, not merely scaffolding to be discarded once results are obtained.

### 3. Use of Computational and Agentic Systems

<!--
AI and agentic systems as tools within human-led workflows (research and education).
Explicit prohibitions on delegating authority or accountability.
Requirements for legibility, auditability, and oversight.
Role of AI in augmenting but not replacing human learning and inquiry.
-->

Educational programs covered by this Charter integrate AI as a foundational assumption, not an optional enhancement. Students must learn to work effectively with AI tools while developing capacities that remain uniquely human.

**Two Complementary Pillars**:

**Teaching AI** — Students develop judgment and workflow literacy that transfers across tools:
- **Effective AI Workflows**: Environments that support thinking rather than replacing it, creating natural checkpoints for reflection and making students more thoughtful, not just faster
- **Sustained Projects**: Strategies for managing extended work—maintaining plans, preserving context across sessions, and keeping AI collaborators aligned with evolving objectives
- **Security and Privacy**: Understanding data flows, handling sensitive information, recognizing manipulation vectors, and operational security awareness
- **Human Collaboration**: AI as part of broader collaborative environments, facilitating shared context, handoffs, and asynchronous work with other people
- **Metacognitive Awareness**: Learning to recognize where AI-assisted workflows break down—when AI outputs are subtly wrong, when the framing is off, when the confident answer misses the point. This requires concrete experience with AI failures, not just AI successes, building the diagnostic capacity to identify deviation and communicate corrections effectively. Metacognitive skill transfers across tools and capability levels.

**Teaching with AI** — Using AI as a medium through which students develop genuine conceptual understanding:
- **Problem Posing over Problem Solving**: While AI systems solve problems, humans remain essential for identifying what's worth solving, framing ambiguous situations, and recognizing when solutions address real needs. Education shifts toward developing these problem-posing abilities.
- **Assessment of Judgment**: Evaluation focuses not on answer correctness but on problem framing, approach appropriateness, error identification in AI outputs, and meaningful improvements upon AI-generated solutions. Assessment evaluates questions and judgment, not just answers.
- **Designing for Uncertainty**: Rather than assignments built around current AI limitations, develop students' capacity to work productively with AI systems of any capability level. The core question remains: what uniquely human contributions are valuable, and how do we develop students' ability to make them?

**Implementation Requirements**:
- AI integration is not optional—students and faculty are already using these tools
- Learning experiences must remain meaningful when students have access to powerful AI collaborators
- Assessment must distinguish between human judgment and AI execution
- Privacy and security awareness must be taught explicitly and reinforced continuously

**Curriculum Agility**

Educational programs covered by this Charter must be designed to iterate in real-time with advances in AI capability. Best practices for teaching how to work with AI are in their infancy; what works today may be obsolete or counterproductive within months.

This requires:

- **Modular curriculum design**: Programs structured so that components can be updated, replaced, or removed without requiring wholesale redesign
- **Continuous experimentation**: Faculty empowered to try different pedagogical approaches, with mechanisms for sharing what works and abandoning what doesn't
- **Rapid feedback loops**: Assessment and evaluation cycles short enough to detect when approaches stop working, before entire cohorts are affected
- **Documented learning**: When curriculum changes, the reasoning and results should be captured so that institutional knowledge accumulates rather than cycling through the same discoveries

Curriculum agility is not instability. The goal is structured adaptability—maintaining coherent educational aims while remaining responsive to a rapidly changing technological environment. Programs that cannot evolve will either become irrelevant or will force students to learn outdated practices they must immediately unlearn.

---

## V. Institutional Relationships

This section articulates how the Charter understands and governs relationships among participating institutions. These relationships are not assumed to be flat or symmetrical. Instead, they are treated as **explicitly designed interfaces** between organizations with different mandates, tempos, and constraints.

The aim is not to dissolve institutional boundaries, but to enable **productive coupling** across them—preserving accountability, authority, and trust while allowing for experimentation and collaboration.

### 1. Roles and Positions

The ecosystem covered by this Charter comprises individuals in the following broad categories:

**Director** — Executive leadership with strategic and operational authority over one or more institutional units (Henkaku Center, SDS, or designated programs). Directors bear ultimate accountability for organizational direction, resource allocation, and alignment with Charter principles.

**Faculty** — Members holding academic appointments within SDS, responsible for curriculum, student mentorship, and degree program integrity. Faculty simultaneously function as **Principal Researchers**, leading research initiatives and bearing accountability for research outcomes. This dual role reflects the Charter's commitment to integrating education and research practice.

**Principal Researchers** — Individuals who lead and bear accountability for research projects, whether or not they hold faculty appointments. Principal researchers are responsible for project design, execution, and outcomes within their domains.

**Researchers** — Individuals engaged in research activities under the guidance of principal researchers or faculty. Researchers contribute to project execution but do not bear primary accountability for project-level decisions.

**Staff** — Individuals providing operational, administrative, or technical support. Staff enable the functioning of research and educational programs without bearing direct academic or research accountability.

**Visiting Researchers** — Individuals temporarily affiliated with the ecosystem for research purposes, typically maintaining primary appointments elsewhere. Visiting researchers operate under the guidance of a faculty member or principal researcher who serves as their institutional liaison.

**Affiliates** — Individuals with formal but non-employment relationships to the ecosystem—including adjunct faculty, advisors, collaborators, and partners. Affiliates may participate in research, education, or governance according to the terms of their affiliation.

These categories are not mutually exclusive beyond the structural constraints noted above. Individuals may hold multiple roles, and role boundaries may evolve as the ecosystem matures. What matters is clarity: at any given moment, for any given activity, individuals should be able to identify which role they occupy and what accountability that role entails.

### 2. Chiba Institute of Technology (Host Institution)

<!--
Describe Chiba Tech as the host institution that provides legal standing,
infrastructure, and long-term continuity.

Acknowledge that while Chiba Tech is forward-looking, it necessarily
operates under constraints of scale, regulation, and tradition.

State that antidisciplinary and experimental work is pursued within
these constraints, not in opposition to them.
-->

Chiba Institute of Technology serves as the host institution for the Henkaku Center and SDS, providing legal standing, infrastructure, and long-term continuity.

Founded in 1942 as Kōa Institute of Technology, Chiba Tech is Japan's oldest private technology institute, with approximately 10,000 students across undergraduate, graduate, and vocational programs. It brings institutional stability, established administrative systems, and deep roots in Japanese engineering education.

**Operating Within Constraints**

Chiba Tech is forward-looking but necessarily operates under constraints of scale, regulation, and tradition that smaller or newer organizations do not face. These constraints include:

- Regulatory requirements governing accredited degree programs
- Administrative systems designed for conventional academic operations
- Stakeholder relationships built over decades
- Cultural expectations associated with established institutions

These constraints are real and must be respected. Antidisciplinary and experimental work is pursued within these constraints, not in opposition to them. The goal is creative operation within institutional boundaries, not circumvention or conflict.

**Mutual Benefit**

The relationship is designed for mutual benefit:

- Henkaku Center and SDS gain institutional legitimacy, infrastructure, and access to a large student body and established networks
- Chiba Tech gains innovation capacity, international visibility, and models that may inform broader institutional evolution

Neither entity subsumes the other. The relationship is one of productive coupling—distinct organizations with different characters, working together while maintaining their separate identities.

**Physical Presence and Campus Integration**

In-person activities of the Henkaku Center and SDS should be primarily based at the **Chiba Institute of Technology Tsudanuma Campus**. This expectation reflects several commitments:

- **Institutional integration**: Physical presence on campus reinforces that Henkaku Center and SDS are part of Chiba Tech, not separate entities that happen to share an affiliation. Visibility and proximity support collaboration with the broader university community.

- **Shared infrastructure**: Tsudanuma Campus provides facilities, services, and administrative support that enable research and education. Making use of this infrastructure honors the relationship with the host institution.

- **Community formation**: Regular physical co-presence builds relationships, trust, and informal knowledge exchange that remote interaction cannot fully replicate.

Off-campus events, external venue meetings, and remote participation are permissible and sometimes necessary. However, good faith effort should be made to hold activities at Tsudanuma whenever reasonably possible. The default assumption is on-campus presence; departures from this default should have clear justification (venue requirements, partner convenience, accessibility needs, or similar considerations).

### 3. Henkaku Center and Graduate School of Design & Science (SDS)

<!--
Describe Henkaku Center and SDS as distinct but closely coupled entities.

Clarify that:
- Henkaku Center functions as a research and experimentation arm,
  supporting exploratory work, infrastructure, and cross-cutting initiatives.
- SDS functions as the academic arm, responsible for curriculum,
  degrees, and student learning.

State that faculty and students may participate in both contexts,
but that governance, accountability, and evaluation differ by role.
-->

The Henkaku Center and the Graduate School of Design & Science (SDS) are distinct but closely coupled entities within the Chiba Tech ecosystem.

**Henkaku Center**

The Henkaku Center for Radical Transformation functions as a research and experimentation arm. Its scope includes:

- Exploratory research that may not fit conventional academic categories
- Infrastructure development—tools, platforms, and systems that support the broader ecosystem
- Cross-cutting initiatives that span education, research, and external engagement
- Experimental programs that test new approaches before broader adoption
- Convening and coordination across the ecosystem

The Henkaku Center operates with more flexibility than a degree-granting program, enabling rapid experimentation and unconventional approaches.

**Graduate School of Design & Science (SDS)**

SDS functions as the academic arm, responsible for:

- Curriculum design and delivery
- Degree programs and academic credentials
- Student admissions, progression, and graduation
- Academic assessment and quality assurance
- Faculty appointments in their academic dimension

SDS operates under the regulatory requirements governing accredited graduate programs, with corresponding accountability for academic standards.

**Relationship Between Entities**

Faculty and students may participate in both Henkaku Center and SDS contexts. A faculty member might teach in SDS while leading a Henkaku Center research initiative. A student might pursue an SDS degree while contributing to Henkaku Center projects.

However, governance, accountability, and evaluation differ by context:

- Academic matters (curriculum, degrees, student standing) are governed through SDS
- Research initiatives and experimental programs may be governed through Henkaku Center
- Some activities involve both and require coordination

The entities share values, leadership, and many participants, but maintain distinct identities appropriate to their different functions.

### 4. Interaction, Flow, and Boundary Management

<!--
Describe how students, faculty, and researchers may move between
SDS and Henkaku Center contexts.

Emphasize that:
- Roles and expectations are context-dependent
- Authority does not automatically transfer across contexts
- Transparency and role clarity are required when operating across boundaries
-->

Participants in this ecosystem frequently operate across institutional boundaries—between SDS and Henkaku Center, between academic and research roles, between internal work and external engagement. Managing these boundaries requires explicit attention.

**Context-Dependent Roles and Expectations**

Roles and expectations vary by context:

- A faculty member advising a student's thesis operates under academic norms and owes duties appropriate to that relationship
- The same faculty member leading a Henkaku Center initiative operates as a project lead with different accountability structures
- A student working on coursework has different standing than the same student contributing to a research project

These are not contradictions—they are different contexts with different expectations. Participants should be clear about which context they are operating in at any given moment.

**Authority Does Not Automatically Transfer**

Authority in one context does not automatically confer authority in another:

- Academic seniority does not automatically translate to decision-making authority in research projects
- Leadership of a Henkaku Center initiative does not confer authority over SDS academic matters
- External reputation does not override internal governance processes

When authority is needed across contexts, it must be explicitly granted through appropriate channels, not assumed based on status elsewhere.

**Transparency and Role Clarity**

Operating across boundaries requires:

- **Explicit identification**: When context is ambiguous, participants should clarify which role they are occupying and which authority they are exercising
- **Conflict acknowledgment**: When roles create conflicts of interest, those conflicts should be disclosed and managed
- **Boundary respect**: Participants should not use access gained in one role to exercise influence inappropriate to another

The goal is not rigid separation—productive coupling requires fluid movement across boundaries—but clarity about what role one is playing and what expectations apply.

### 5. Affiliates, Visiting Researchers, and External Partners

<!--
Expectations for alignment with this Charter.
Rights and responsibilities of affiliation.
Norms for exit, disengagement, and dissociation.
-->

**Industry Integration**

This Charter encourages active collaboration with industry partners, including joint supervision of students shared between companies and the institution. Such arrangements recognize that:

- Real-world problems provide learning opportunities that purely academic settings cannot replicate
- Industry partners bring domain expertise, data, and constraints that enrich research and education
- Students benefit from exposure to professional practice before graduation
- Companies gain access to emerging talent and fresh perspectives

Joint supervision means genuine shared responsibility—industry partners participate in defining project scope, providing mentorship, and evaluating outcomes, not merely funding or hosting interns. Students in joint supervision arrangements have accountable mentors in both contexts.

**Expectations for External Partners**

External partners—whether industry collaborators, visiting researchers, or affiliates—are expected to operate consistently with Charter principles while engaged with Charter-covered programs. This includes:

- Respect for human primacy and accountability in AI-assisted work
- Commitment to intellectual integrity and transparency appropriate to the collaboration
- Recognition of student and researcher agency and development as goals, not merely deliverables
- Willingness to engage with the institution's cultural and methodological commitments

Alignment does not require agreement on all matters, but it does require good faith engagement with the principles articulated here. Partners who find Charter principles incompatible with their operations should seek collaboration elsewhere.

## VI. Governance and Stewardship

### 1. Stewardship of the Charter

<!--
Who may propose changes.
How changes are reviewed and evaluated.
Role of precedent and version history.
-->

This Charter is a living document requiring active stewardship. Changes should be possible when needed, but not so easy that the document loses stability and authority.

**Who May Propose Changes**

Any participant in the ecosystem covered by this Charter may propose changes:

- Faculty, researchers, and staff of Henkaku Center and SDS
- Students enrolled in Charter-covered programs
- Affiliates and visiting researchers during their engagement

Proposals should be submitted through the version control system that maintains the Charter, with clear description of the proposed change and its rationale.

**How Changes Are Reviewed**

Proposed changes are reviewed through a process that balances openness with rigor:

- **Minor clarifications** (typos, formatting, non-substantive wording) may be approved by any Charter steward
- **Substantive additions or modifications** require review by multiple stakeholders and explicit approval from designated authority
- **Changes to foundational principles** require broader consultation and higher approval thresholds

The specific approval requirements should be documented and maintained alongside the Charter.

**Role of Version History**

The version history of this Charter is itself a governance document:

- All changes are tracked and attributable to human decision-makers
- Previous versions remain accessible, showing how the Charter has evolved
- The reasoning behind significant changes should be captured in commit messages or accompanying documentation
- Patterns in the Charter's evolution—what has been added, removed, or modified—provide guidance for interpretation

Version history makes "institutional drift" visible. When principles evolve, that evolution should be traceable and explicable.

**Precedent and Interpretation**

Over time, interpretations and applications of Charter principles create precedent. These precedents should be:

- Documented when they represent significant interpretive choices
- Consulted when similar situations arise
- Revisable when circumstances change or earlier interpretations prove problematic

The Charter text is primary, but the history of its application provides context for understanding what the text means in practice.

### 2. Decision-Making Principles

<!--
When consensus is required.
When delegated authority is appropriate.
How disagreements and irreconcilable views are handled.
-->

Organizations covered by this Charter operate as **decentralized, horizontally-structured communities** where authority derives from commitment to execution rather than formal designation. This approach recognizes that coordination without rigid hierarchy requires explicit design.

**Horizontal Authority**

Authority and status are distributed rather than concentrated. Influence flows from demonstrated willingness to do work, not from positional power or informal designation. This creates legitimacy through action: those who commit time and effort to executing decisions earn authority to make them.

**Group Formation and Participation Pathways**

Working groups form through **explicit participation pathways** with clear execution commitments:

- **Open Invitations**: Opportunities to participate in initiatives should be made explicit, even when uptake is expected to be small. Visibility of participation pathways prevents later "who decided this?" dynamics and establishes that membership is tied to work, not status.

- **Self-Selection Through Commitment**: Invitations include specific time and execution requirements. This creates natural filtering—only those willing to do real work join, resulting in small, focused, accountable groups with clear legitimacy.

- **Work-Based Membership**: Membership in decision-making groups is earned through willingness to contribute, not granted through informal designation or social proximity. This ties authority directly to accountability.

- **Transparent Process**: Even if few people opt in, the existence of visible participation opportunities establishes fairness. Transparency in process supports small group size while maintaining legitimacy.

**Decision-Making in Practice**

Effective decision-making in horizontal structures balances focus with openness:

- **Small, Accountable Groups**: Decision-making groups should remain small, especially where subjective judgment is involved (design, tone, framing). Size is controlled through execution commitment requirements, not arbitrary closure.

- **Early Constraint Surfacing**: Openness early in processes helps surface technical, structural, and coordination constraints before decisions harden. This is particularly important when work has both subjective elements (design) and objective dimensions (architecture, maintenance, workflows).

- **Focused but Not Closed**: Working groups stay focused by requiring commitment, not by being invitation-only or informally constituted. The distinction is critical: focused execution with transparent access, rather than informal designation.

- **Preventing Drift**: Without explicit pathways and work-based membership, horizontal communities risk defaulting to informal power structures based on social proximity rather than contribution. Charter-governed organizations must actively design against this.

**Legitimacy and Accountability**

In decentralized settings, legitimacy requires:

1. **Transparent Opportunities**: Participation pathways must be visible, even if not widely taken up
2. **Commitment-Based Selection**: Authority tied to willingness to execute, not designation
3. **Small Group Execution**: Actual work done by focused teams with accountability
4. **Fair Process**: Openness in opportunity creation, focus in execution

This approach produces working groups that are both small (through self-selection) and legitimate (through transparent access), avoiding the coordination failures of both diffuse committees and closed informal networks.

### 3. Conflict, Accountability, and Repair

<!--
Processes for addressing harm or misconduct.
Distinction between personal conflict and institutional failure.
Emphasis on repair over punishment-first responses.
-->

**Non-Antagonistic Engagement**

This Charter embraces a distinctive stance toward disagreement and change: engagement through invitation and demonstration rather than opposition and critique. This does not mean avoiding conflict or suppressing disagreement—it means choosing how to engage with difference.

Non-antagonistic engagement reflects several commitments:

- **Future-oriented optimism**: Energy directed toward building what should exist, rather than primarily attacking what currently does. Critique has its place, but construction is the primary mode.

- **Assuming good faith**: Beginning from the assumption that those who disagree may have legitimate reasons, different information, or different values—not that they are malicious or stupid. This assumption can be revised with evidence, but it is the starting point.

- **Invitation over coercion**: Change happens most durably when people choose it. Persuasion, demonstration, and creating attractive alternatives are preferred to force, shame, or exclusion. People who aren't ready to join aren't enemies.

- **Holding disagreement without rupture**: It is possible to disagree profoundly while maintaining relationship and mutual respect. Not every conflict requires resolution; some require only management. The goal is productive coexistence, not ideological uniformity.

This stance is not naivety or conflict avoidance. Some situations require direct confrontation; some actors operate in bad faith; some harms demand clear opposition. But antagonism as a *default mode*—treating disagreement as combat, seeking to defeat rather than persuade—is corrosive to the collaborative culture this Charter seeks to build.

The aim is a community that can hold difference, work through conflict, and emerge with relationships intact.

## VII. Evolution and Adaptation

### 1. Living Nature of the Charter

<!--
Versioning and historical traceability.
Conditions for revision, deprecation, or removal of sections.
-->

This Charter is designed to evolve. Unlike traditional institutional documents that are drafted once and archived, this Charter is maintained as a living document under version control.

**Versioning and Traceability**

The Charter is maintained in a version control system that provides:

- **Complete history**: Every change is recorded, with timestamp and attribution
- **Traceability**: Any current provision can be traced back to when and why it was added or modified
- **Transparency**: The full history is accessible to all participants
- **Accountability**: Changes are attributed to human decision-makers, not anonymous processes

This approach treats institutional principles the way software treats code: as artifacts that evolve through transparent, traceable, accountable processes.

**Conditions for Revision**

Revisions may be proposed when:

- Experience reveals gaps, ambiguities, or unintended consequences in existing provisions
- Circumstances change in ways that make existing provisions obsolete or counterproductive
- New understanding suggests better ways to articulate existing commitments
- The ecosystem expands to encompass situations not anticipated in current text

Revisions should be accompanied by rationale explaining why change is needed.

**Deprecation and Removal**

Sections may be deprecated (marked as no longer active) or removed when:

- They address situations that no longer exist
- They have been superseded by other provisions
- Experience has shown them to be counterproductive

Deprecated sections should be retained in version history with explanation of why they were deprecated. Complete removal should be rare and well-justified.

**Stability and Change**

The Charter should be stable enough to provide reliable guidance and flexible enough to remain relevant. This balance requires:

- Resistance to changes that merely reflect passing preferences
- Openness to changes that address genuine problems
- Periodic review to assess whether the Charter is serving its purpose
- Recognition that some principles are more fundamental than others and should change more slowly

### 2. Portability and Reuse

<!--
Conditions under which this Charter may be reused or adapted elsewhere.
Forking vs adoption.
Obligations of derivative charters.
-->

This Charter is designed to be portable. Other organizations may find value in adapting its principles for their own contexts.

**Conditions for Reuse**

This Charter may be reused, adapted, and modified by others subject to:

- **Attribution**: Derivative works should acknowledge this Charter as a source
- **No false endorsement**: Derivative works should not imply endorsement by Henkaku Center, SDS, or Chiba Tech unless such endorsement is explicitly granted
- **Transparency**: Organizations adopting or adapting this Charter should make clear what they have adopted, adapted, or omitted

These conditions are meant to enable reuse while maintaining clarity about provenance and relationship.

**Forking vs. Adoption**

Organizations may engage with this Charter in different ways:

- **Adoption**: Committing to operate according to this Charter, participating in its governance, and accepting its authority. Adoption implies ongoing relationship with the Charter's stewards.

- **Forking**: Creating a derivative Charter that diverges from this one. Forking is legitimate when an organization's needs differ enough that ongoing alignment is not appropriate. Forks should be clearly identified as such.

- **Inspiration**: Drawing on Charter principles without formal adoption or forking. This is the lightest form of engagement and carries no ongoing obligations.

**Obligations of Derivative Charters**

Organizations that fork this Charter are encouraged but not required to:

- Contribute improvements back to the source Charter when applicable
- Maintain compatibility where possible, enabling collaboration across Charter-derived communities
- Document their modifications and rationale, supporting learning across the ecosystem

The goal is to enable a family of related Charters that share common ancestry while adapting to different contexts—similar to how open-source software forks can diverge while maintaining connection.
