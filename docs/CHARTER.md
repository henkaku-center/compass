# Charter

---

## Preamble

<!--
Purpose:
- State the scope and intent of this Charter.
- Specify who this Charter applies to (institutions, affiliates, researchers, collaborators).
- Clarify what this Charter is *not* (e.g., not a legal contract, not a policy manual, not branding).
-->

---

## I. Foundational Orientations

<!--
These conceptual orientations define the guiding ethos of the organizations
covered by this Charter in conceptual space. Each principle represents a
directional orientation along a contested axis—a deliberate choice about what
we prioritize.

These are not absolute rules but preferential tensions. "Resilience over
strength" does not reject strength, but signals that resilience is the primary
optimization target.
-->

**RESILIENCE** over strength.  
強さではなく、しなやかさを持つ。

**SYSTEMS** over objects.  
モノではなく、システムに焦点を合わせる。

**DISOBEDIENCE** over compliance.  
服従ではなく、反抗する。

**PULL** over push.  
「押す」のではなく、「引く」。

**COMPASSES** over maps.  
地図ではなく、良いコンパスを持つ。

**EMERGENCE** over authority.  
専門家ではなく、クラウド（人々）に向かう。

**RISK** over safety.  
安全ではなく、リスクを取る。

**PRACTICE** over theory.  
理論ではなく、実践に基づく。

**LEARNING** over education.  
教育ではなく、学びに焦点を当てる。

**SUSTAINABILITY** over growth.  
拡大ではなく、持続可能性。

**PUBLIC** over individuals.  
個人の利益ではなく、公共的な視点を持つこと。

**MODULAR** over monolithic.
一枚岩ではなく、モジュール型のデザインを意識すること。

---

**Balancing Dichotomies**

Beyond directional orientations, this Charter also embraces productive tensions—qualities that might seem opposed yet must be held together. These dichotomies define the institutional character:

- **Inclusive yet Elite**: Open to diverse participants and perspectives, yet uncompromising on standards of excellence and rigor.

- **Broad yet Deep**: Spanning disciplines and domains, yet pursuing genuine depth rather than superficial coverage.

- **Diverse yet Harmonious**: Welcoming difference and disagreement, yet cultivating coherence and the ability to act together.

- **Calm yet Exciting**: Maintaining groundedness and stability, yet generating energy and momentum.

- **Confident yet Thrilling**: Acting with conviction and clarity, yet remaining open to surprise and the unexpected.

- **Happy yet Aspirational**: Creating environments where people flourish now, yet always reaching toward what could be better.

These are not compromises or midpoints. They are both/and commitments—holding apparent opposites in creative tension rather than collapsing into either pole.

## II. Values and Commitments

### 1. Antidisciplinarity

<!--
Define antidisciplinarity.
Clarify how it differs from interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity.
Explain when disciplinary rigor is required and when it is intentionally suspended.
-->

### 2. Radical Transformation

<!--
Define "radical transformation" as structural, not cosmetic, change.
Clarify the difference between incremental improvement and transformation at the level of systems, institutions, and coordination mechanisms.
State that radical transformation is pursued deliberately, cautiously, and with awareness of second-order effects.
-->

**Human Flourishing as the Aim**

The purpose of transformation is not change for its own sake, but the cultivation of conditions under which humans can flourish. This Charter commits to an understanding of flourishing that encompasses—but extends beyond—productivity, efficiency, and skill acquisition.

Flourishing includes the development of capacities for meaning-making, ethical judgment, creative expression, and genuine connection with others. Educational and research programs covered by this Charter aim not merely to produce competent practitioners, but to cultivate people who can live well, contribute meaningfully, and help others do the same.

This framing has practical implications: when evaluating programs, projects, and institutional decisions, the question is not only "does this work?" but "does this contribute to the flourishing of those involved and affected?" Transformation that optimizes narrow metrics while undermining wellbeing, relationships, or meaning is not radical transformation—it is misdirection.

### 3. Human and Artificial Intelligence

<!--
This section establishes how human and artificial intelligence interact
within the scope of this Charter.

Key principles to articulate here:

- Artificial intelligence systems do not possess moral, legal, or institutional agency.
  They may act within defined workflows, but they do not bear responsibility or authority.
- Human agency may be amplified through computational and agentic systems,
  but it may not be transferred or abdicated.
- Every decision, action, or outcome produced with the assistance of AI
  must have a clear and identifiable line of human accountability.
- Agentic workflows are treated as designed coordination systems,
  including their interfaces, constraints, feedback loops, and escalation paths.
- As system autonomy increases, requirements for oversight, legibility,
  auditability, and intervention increase proportionally.

Ambiguity of responsibility in human–machine systems is considered a
design failure and must be addressed through governance, tooling, or process.
-->

### 4. Intellectual Integrity

<!--
Commitments to truth-seeking, clarity, and rigor.
Distinguish speculation, research, and deployment.
-->

**Resisting Reduction**

The world is complex, and this Charter resists the impulse to reduce that complexity to easy answers or suspiciously straightforward solutions. Problems worth solving are rarely simple; they are interconnected, context-dependent, and adaptive to changing conditions.

Resisting reduction means:

- **Embracing nuance**: Acknowledging ambiguity, variation, and contested interpretations rather than flattening them into false clarity. When reality is messy, our representations of it should preserve that messiness rather than pretend it away.

- **Questioning quantification**: The tendency to treat everything as countable—and therefore monetizable or optimizable—comes from industrial-era thinking that renders reality into ones and zeroes. Not everything that matters can be measured, and not everything that can be measured matters. Numbers are tools, not truths.

- **Holding multiple frames**: Complex situations often require multiple explanatory frameworks that cannot be fully reconciled. Intellectual integrity means being able to work within a frame while remaining aware of its limitations and the validity of alternative perspectives.

- **Resisting premature closure**: The pressure to have answers, make decisions, and move on often leads to conclusions that foreclose better understanding. Staying with uncertainty longer than is comfortable often produces better outcomes than rushing to resolution.

This is not an argument against clarity or decisiveness. Resisting reduction is compatible with taking action under uncertainty—it simply requires honesty about what we don't know and humility about the limits of our models.

**Valuing What Escapes Measurement**

"If you can measure it, it probably isn't magic."

The most significant outcomes—transformation, insight, connection, meaning—often resist quantification. This is not a failure of measurement but a feature of what makes them significant. Work that can be fully captured in metrics is, almost by definition, work that operates within existing frameworks rather than transcending them.

This principle complements rather than contradicts the commitment to measurability elsewhere in this Charter. Projects should articulate how outcomes will be evaluated, and accountability requires evidence. But:

- **Metrics are proxies**: They point toward what matters; they are not themselves what matters. Optimizing metrics while losing sight of underlying goals is a common failure mode.

- **Transformative work creates new categories**: The most important outcomes may not be measurable in advance because the frameworks for understanding them don't yet exist. Genuine innovation changes what counts, not just how much.

- **Presence of magic is a positive signal**: When work produces effects that participants struggle to articulate—when it feels meaningful in ways that resist explanation—that difficulty is evidence of depth, not vagueness.

- **Beware metric fixation**: Systems that optimize only what can be measured tend to produce measurable but hollow outcomes. The unmeasurable dimensions often carry the real value.

This is not an excuse for vagueness or an argument against rigor. It is a reminder that intellectual integrity includes honesty about the limits of our instruments, and that some of the most important things we do will be recognized by their resonance rather than their metrics.

### 5. Experimentation and Risk

<!--
Legitimacy of experimentation and failure.
Boundaries on experimentation involving people, institutions, or public trust.
-->

### 6. Cultural and Contextual Respect

<!--
Role of Japanese cultural context as a constraint and resource.
Approach to global collaboration without cultural flattening.
-->

**Neurodiversity and Cognitive Difference**

This Charter explicitly acknowledges and respects **neurodiversity**—the natural variation in human cognition, perception, and interaction. We recognize that people think, feel, learn, and collaborate in fundamentally different ways, and that these differences are sources of strength rather than deficits to be corrected.

Respect for neurodiversity means:

- **Valuing different modes of thinking**: Analytical, intuitive, visual, verbal, linear, associative—different cognitive styles contribute different capabilities. Environments and processes should not implicitly privilege one mode over others.

- **Accommodating different modes of feeling**: Emotional expression, sensory sensitivity, and social energy vary widely. Expectations around interaction, presence, and communication should allow for this variation rather than enforcing a single norm.

- **Supporting different modes of collaborating**: Some people thrive in spontaneous discussion; others need time to process before contributing. Some prefer written communication; others prefer verbal. Collaboration structures should create multiple pathways for meaningful participation.

- **Designing for flexibility**: Physical spaces, meeting formats, communication channels, and work rhythms should be designed with variation in mind—not as afterthought accommodations, but as fundamental assumptions.

- **Making the implicit explicit**: Many people—particularly those on the autism spectrum—thrive when expectations, norms, and "rules of the game" are stated directly rather than left to inference. Environments that require participants to guess at unstated expectations, read between the lines, or navigate unspoken social dynamics create unnecessary barriers. Clear communication about what is expected, what is valued, and how decisions are made benefits everyone and is essential for some.

This commitment extends beyond formal disability accommodation. It reflects a recognition that the full range of human cognitive diversity—including but not limited to autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and other neurological differences—brings perspectives and capabilities that homogeneous environments cannot produce. Explicit norms and direct communication are not merely accommodations—they are better design.

**Awareness Practices and Contemplative Traditions**

Japanese cultural context offers distinctive resources for understanding the relationship between awareness, craft, and human development. Traditions of contemplative practice—including but not limited to tea ceremony, calligraphy, and martial arts—embody ways of knowing that complement analytical and technical approaches.

These traditions emphasize:

- **Direct experience**: Understanding that emerges from practice and presence, not only from abstraction and analysis
- **Attention and sensitivity**: The cultivation of refined perception as a foundation for good judgment and skilled action
- **Integration of body and mind**: Recognition that cognition is embodied, and that physical practice shapes mental capability
- **Process as content**: The insight that how something is done matters as much as what is accomplished

As technical work increasingly involves shaping AI behavior and communicating intent rather than writing explicit instructions, these capacities become not merely cultural enrichment but practical requirements. The ability to perceive subtle patterns, maintain sustained attention, and act with sensitivity to context are technical skills for the AI era.

Programs covered by this Charter are encouraged to integrate awareness practices into education and research—not as mandatory spiritual exercises, but as legitimate methods for developing capacities that conventional curricula often neglect.

### 7. Openness with Discernment

<!--
When openness and transparency are required.
When discretion or confidentiality is necessary.
Tradeoffs between transparency and potential harm.
-->

### 8. Human Primacy and Responsibility

<!--
Assert that authority, accountability, and legitimacy are irreducibly human.
Clarify roles of individuals vs institutions.
Explicitly state limits on delegation to computational or automated systems.
-->

### 9. Coordination as a Design Problem

<!--
Frame coordination as a first-order object of inquiry.
Explain why institutions, processes, and incentives must be designed.
Identify common coordination failure modes this ecosystem seeks to avoid.
-->

---

## III. Research Practice

### 1. Project-Centered Inquiry

<!--
Define projects as the unit of research inquiry.
Criteria for a legitimate research project.
Project lifecycle: initiation, evolution, completion, and archival.
Relationship between research projects and academic outputs.
-->

**Data Humanism**

Research covered by this Charter adopts a humanistic approach to data—recognizing that data is always shaped by human hands, carrying the fingerprints and biases of its creators. Despite appearances of objectivity, data is physical material formed by human agency. The hand of its creator is always present.

This perspective has practical implications:

- **Context matters**: The relationships and circumstances *between* data points are often more important than the points themselves. This "warm data"—the context, the story, the human situation—is rarely captured in standard visualizations but is fundamental to understanding causality and meaning.

- **Collection is interpretation**: How data is gathered, categorized, and cleaned involves countless decisions that shape what can later be seen. Acknowledging this does not undermine data's value; it makes interpretation more honest.

- **Representation is rhetorical**: Charts, graphs, and dashboards are not neutral windows onto reality. They are arguments, crafted by people with perspectives. Reading data visualizations critically—asking who made this, what choices were made, what is not shown—is a research skill.

- **Qualitative and quantitative are complementary**: Numbers without narrative are incomplete; narrative without evidence is speculation. Good research moves between modes, using each to check and enrich the other.

Data humanism does not reject quantification—it refuses to let quantification obscure the human realities it attempts to represent. The goal is not less data but more honest engagement with what data can and cannot tell us.

**Uniqueness as Selection Criterion**

"If someone else can do it, we shouldn't do it."

This principle guides what work this ecosystem pursues. Given finite resources and attention, projects should be selected not merely for importance but for *fit*—work that this particular combination of people, institutions, and capabilities is uniquely positioned to accomplish.

This means:

- **Comparative advantage**: Prioritize work where our specific strengths—antidisciplinary orientation, cultural context, institutional flexibility, network position—create distinctive value that others cannot easily replicate.

- **Avoid redundancy**: Before launching initiatives, ask whether capable others are already doing this work well. If so, consider collaboration, support, or complementary positioning rather than duplication.

- **Embrace the gaps**: The most important work is often what falls between established categories—too applied for academia, too speculative for industry, too cross-cutting for any single discipline. This is where antidisciplinary institutions can contribute most.

- **Accept opportunity cost**: Saying yes to one project means saying no to others. Uniqueness as a criterion helps ensure that the work we do take on is work that wouldn't happen without us.

This is not an argument for obscurity or contrarianism. Important problems deserve attention from many actors. But within the space of important problems, this ecosystem should gravitate toward those where its contribution is irreplaceable.

### 2. Project Registry and Coordination Infrastructure

Organizations covered by this Charter must establish and maintain a **project registry**—a shared platform for defining, submitting, and browsing active projects and initiatives.

The registry serves as coordination infrastructure, making work visible and enabling participants to identify connections, gaps, and conflicts across the ecosystem.

**Projects as Bounded Units of Transformation**: Projects are distinguished from open-ended research programs or permanent organizational functions by their finite, mission-driven nature. Every project must articulate not only what it aims to achieve, but also what would make it complete.

#### Requirements

**Project Definition Template**: Each project submission must articulate:

- **Intent**: What specific situation, breakdown, or opportunity this project addresses, what transformation is being pursued, and why. This includes both the motivating problem and the intended outcome.

- **Scope**: Boundaries of the project—what it includes and excludes, what it will build or measure or change, and what outputs it will produce. Clear scope prevents indefinite expansion and enables evaluation of completeness.

- **Temporal Bounds**: When the project begins, when it is expected to complete, and key milestones along the way. Projects must be time-bounded to maintain focus and accountability.

- **Measurability and Completion**: How impact or progress will be assessed (whether qualitatively or quantitatively), and what specific evidence would indicate success or failure. Projects must also state what would make the work complete—not just successful, but done.

- **Participants**: Who has authority, accountability, and contribution roles. This includes project ownership (who is responsible for delivery) and contributors (who supports the work and in what capacity).

- **Dependencies**: What this project requires from other efforts, and what other efforts depend on this project. Dependencies make coordination visible and help identify critical paths and bottlenecks.

- **Status**: Current state (proposed, active, paused, completed, archived). Status enables tracking project progression through its lifecycle.

- **Resources** (where applicable): Funding sources, resource allocation, and budgeted areas. Financial and material accountability supports transparency and coordination.

**Measurability with Forgiveness**: Projects must articulate how outcomes will be evaluated, but the Charter recognizes that some impacts—especially systemic, cultural, or long-term transformations—resist clean measurement.

Projects should state *what would count as evidence of success or failure*, even if that evidence cannot be fully quantified. Unmeasurable does not mean unevaluable. Qualitative assessment, stakeholder feedback, and narrative evaluation are legitimate forms of measurement.

**Overlap and Coherence Analysis**: The platform must support participants in:
- Identifying **overlapping scope** between projects (potential redundancy or collaboration opportunity)
- Recognizing **distinctiveness** (how projects differ in approach, method, or aim)
- Surfacing **incoherence** (where projects pursue conflicting goals or undermine each other)

This analysis may be manual, computational, or hybrid, but it must be legible and actionable.

#### Governance

- The registry is a **coordination tool**, not an approval mechanism. Projects do not require permission to be listed, but listing signals accountability to Charter principles.
- The registry does not replace formal institutional processes (course approvals, research ethics review, funding applications). It complements them.
- Projects that violate Charter principles may be flagged for review, but the registry itself does not have enforcement authority.

#### Implementation

- The platform must be accessible to all participants covered by this Charter.
- The template may evolve through governance processes (Section VI), but changes must preserve backward compatibility or provide migration paths for existing entries.
- The platform should lower barriers to entry while maintaining clarity—favoring lightweight initial submissions that can be refined over time.
- Implementations should provide guidance and prompts that help project authors meet these requirements without imposing unnecessary bureaucracy.

## IV. Educational Practice

### 1. Project-Centered Learning

<!--
Define projects as the unit of learning and pedagogy.
Criteria for a legitimate educational project.
Relationship between learning projects and academic assessment.
Student agency and ownership in project selection and execution.
-->

### 2. Learning Through Making and Doing

<!--
Role of prototypes, artifacts, simulations, and interventions in education.
Expectation of reflection, documentation, and learning capture.
Integration of theory and practice in project-based learning.
-->

**Vocational Orientation**

This Charter affirms a vocational orientation: the commitment to building things, not merely theorizing about them. Students and researchers are expected to produce artifacts—prototypes, systems, interventions, works—that exist in the world and can be evaluated against reality, not only against abstract criteria.

This orientation does not diminish theory; it insists that theory be tested through practice. The goal is not anti-intellectualism but a refusal to let intellectual work become detached from consequence. Ideas that cannot survive contact with implementation are incomplete.

**Bias Toward Action**

Impact is the art of getting things done. This Charter values tangible outcomes over process theater, shipped work over endless planning, and learning through doing over learning through discussion alone.

A bias toward action means:

- **Default to trying**: When uncertain whether something will work, try it. Small experiments teach more than extended deliberation. Failure is information; paralysis is not.

- **Finish things**: Starting is easy; finishing is hard. The discipline of completing work—pushing through the difficult final stages, making hard decisions, accepting imperfection—is itself a core competency.

- **Reduce time to feedback**: The faster work reaches reality, the faster learning happens. Tight feedback loops between intention and outcome are more valuable than elaborate upfront planning.

- **Distinguish motion from progress**: Activity is not accomplishment. Meetings, documents, and discussions are means, not ends. The question is always: what changed in the world?

This is not an argument against reflection, planning, or careful thought. It is an argument against using those activities as substitutes for action, or as ways to avoid the vulnerability of putting work into the world where it can be judged.

**Unity of Function and Design**

Pursuing design excellence directly improves performance. Aesthetics and function are not separate concerns to be traded off against each other, but deeply intertwined aspects of good work. This principle rejects the assumption that something must be ugly to be functional, or that beauty is a luxury applied after engineering problems are solved.

In practice, this means:

- Design decisions are engineering decisions, and engineering decisions are design decisions
- How something looks, feels, and communicates is inseparable from how well it works
- Attention to craft and finish is not indulgence but discipline
- The pursuit of elegance often reveals simpler, better solutions

Students learn to integrate design thinking with technical implementation from the beginning, not as a separate phase or specialty.

**Process as Content**

The unique identity of a work is expressed not only through what it is, but through how it was made. Process is not merely a means to an end—it is itself content, carrying meaning and value independent of the final artifact.

This principle draws from craft traditions where the maker's presence remains visible in the work:

- **Indexical traces**: The evidence of human hands—brush strokes, tool marks, variations in rhythm—conveys authenticity and care that machine-perfect uniformity cannot. These traces are not flaws to be eliminated but signatures to be valued.

- **Visible repair**: The Japanese tradition of kintsugi—repairing broken pottery with gold—exemplifies how damage and restoration can become part of an object's beauty and meaning. Work that shows its history, including its failures and repairs, tells a richer story than work that hides its past.

- **Tacit knowledge transmission**: Some knowledge cannot be fully articulated in words or diagrams; it must be transmitted through practice, demonstration, and apprenticeship. Making things together is a way of sharing understanding that documentation alone cannot capture.

- **Process-intensive learning**: Students learn not just by producing outputs but by engaging in processes—iteration, revision, collaboration, failure, repair. The discipline of sustained making develops capacities that no amount of reading or discussion can substitute.

In educational contexts, this means valuing works-in-progress, documenting process alongside product, and creating space for the slow development of craft. In research contexts, it means treating methodology as substantive intellectual contribution, not merely scaffolding to be discarded once results are obtained.

### 3. Use of Computational and Agentic Systems

<!--
AI and agentic systems as tools within human-led workflows (research and education).
Explicit prohibitions on delegating authority or accountability.
Requirements for legibility, auditability, and oversight.
Role of AI in augmenting but not replacing human learning and inquiry.
-->

Educational programs covered by this Charter integrate AI as a foundational assumption, not an optional enhancement. Students must learn to work effectively with AI tools while developing capacities that remain uniquely human.

**Two Complementary Pillars**:

**Teaching AI** — Students develop judgment and workflow literacy that transfers across tools:
- **Effective AI Workflows**: Environments that support thinking rather than replacing it, creating natural checkpoints for reflection and making students more thoughtful, not just faster
- **Sustained Projects**: Strategies for managing extended work—maintaining plans, preserving context across sessions, and keeping AI collaborators aligned with evolving objectives
- **Security and Privacy**: Understanding data flows, handling sensitive information, recognizing manipulation vectors, and operational security awareness
- **Human Collaboration**: AI as part of broader collaborative environments, facilitating shared context, handoffs, and asynchronous work with other people
- **Metacognitive Awareness**: Learning to recognize where AI-assisted workflows break down—when AI outputs are subtly wrong, when the framing is off, when the confident answer misses the point. This requires concrete experience with AI failures, not just AI successes, building the diagnostic capacity to identify deviation and communicate corrections effectively. Metacognitive skill transfers across tools and capability levels.

**Teaching with AI** — Using AI as a medium through which students develop genuine conceptual understanding:
- **Problem Posing over Problem Solving**: While AI systems solve problems, humans remain essential for identifying what's worth solving, framing ambiguous situations, and recognizing when solutions address real needs. Education shifts toward developing these problem-posing abilities.
- **Assessment of Judgment**: Evaluation focuses not on answer correctness but on problem framing, approach appropriateness, error identification in AI outputs, and meaningful improvements upon AI-generated solutions. Assessment evaluates questions and judgment, not just answers.
- **Designing for Uncertainty**: Rather than assignments built around current AI limitations, develop students' capacity to work productively with AI systems of any capability level. The core question remains: what uniquely human contributions are valuable, and how do we develop students' ability to make them?

**Implementation Requirements**:
- AI integration is not optional—students and faculty are already using these tools
- Learning experiences must remain meaningful when students have access to powerful AI collaborators
- Assessment must distinguish between human judgment and AI execution
- Privacy and security awareness must be taught explicitly and reinforced continuously

**Curriculum Agility**

Educational programs covered by this Charter must be designed to iterate in real-time with advances in AI capability. Best practices for teaching how to work with AI are in their infancy; what works today may be obsolete or counterproductive within months.

This requires:

- **Modular curriculum design**: Programs structured so that components can be updated, replaced, or removed without requiring wholesale redesign
- **Continuous experimentation**: Faculty empowered to try different pedagogical approaches, with mechanisms for sharing what works and abandoning what doesn't
- **Rapid feedback loops**: Assessment and evaluation cycles short enough to detect when approaches stop working, before entire cohorts are affected
- **Documented learning**: When curriculum changes, the reasoning and results should be captured so that institutional knowledge accumulates rather than cycling through the same discoveries

Curriculum agility is not instability. The goal is structured adaptability—maintaining coherent educational aims while remaining responsive to a rapidly changing technological environment. Programs that cannot evolve will either become irrelevant or will force students to learn outdated practices they must immediately unlearn.

---

## V. Institutional Relationships

This section articulates how the Charter understands and governs relationships among participating institutions. These relationships are not assumed to be flat or symmetrical. Instead, they are treated as **explicitly designed interfaces** between organizations with different mandates, tempos, and constraints.

The aim is not to dissolve institutional boundaries, but to enable **productive coupling** across them—preserving accountability, authority, and trust while allowing for experimentation and collaboration.

### 1. Roles and Positions

The ecosystem covered by this Charter comprises individuals in the following broad categories:

**Director** — Executive leadership with strategic and operational authority over one or more institutional units (Henkaku Center, SDS, or designated programs). Directors bear ultimate accountability for organizational direction, resource allocation, and alignment with Charter principles.

**Faculty** — Members holding academic appointments within SDS, responsible for curriculum, student mentorship, and degree program integrity. Faculty simultaneously function as **Principal Researchers**, leading research initiatives and bearing accountability for research outcomes. This dual role reflects the Charter's commitment to integrating education and research practice.

**Principal Researchers** — Individuals who lead and bear accountability for research projects, whether or not they hold faculty appointments. Principal researchers are responsible for project design, execution, and outcomes within their domains.

**Researchers** — Individuals engaged in research activities under the guidance of principal researchers or faculty. Researchers contribute to project execution but do not bear primary accountability for project-level decisions.

**Staff** — Individuals providing operational, administrative, or technical support. Staff enable the functioning of research and educational programs without bearing direct academic or research accountability.

**Visiting Researchers** — Individuals temporarily affiliated with the ecosystem for research purposes, typically maintaining primary appointments elsewhere. Visiting researchers operate under the guidance of a faculty member or principal researcher who serves as their institutional liaison.

**Affiliates** — Individuals with formal but non-employment relationships to the ecosystem—including adjunct faculty, advisors, collaborators, and partners. Affiliates may participate in research, education, or governance according to the terms of their affiliation.

These categories are not mutually exclusive beyond the structural constraints noted above. Individuals may hold multiple roles, and role boundaries may evolve as the ecosystem matures. What matters is clarity: at any given moment, for any given activity, individuals should be able to identify which role they occupy and what accountability that role entails.

### 2. Chiba Institute of Technology (Host Institution)

<!--
Describe Chiba Tech as the host institution that provides legal standing,
infrastructure, and long-term continuity.

Acknowledge that while Chiba Tech is forward-looking, it necessarily
operates under constraints of scale, regulation, and tradition.

State that antidisciplinary and experimental work is pursued within
these constraints, not in opposition to them.
-->

**Physical Presence and Campus Integration**

In-person activities of the Henkaku Center and SDS should be primarily based at the **Chiba Institute of Technology Tsudanuma Campus**. This expectation reflects several commitments:

- **Institutional integration**: Physical presence on campus reinforces that Henkaku Center and SDS are part of Chiba Tech, not separate entities that happen to share an affiliation. Visibility and proximity support collaboration with the broader university community.

- **Shared infrastructure**: Tsudanuma Campus provides facilities, services, and administrative support that enable research and education. Making use of this infrastructure honors the relationship with the host institution.

- **Community formation**: Regular physical co-presence builds relationships, trust, and informal knowledge exchange that remote interaction cannot fully replicate.

Off-campus events, external venue meetings, and remote participation are permissible and sometimes necessary. However, good faith effort should be made to hold activities at Tsudanuma whenever reasonably possible. The default assumption is on-campus presence; departures from this default should have clear justification (venue requirements, partner convenience, accessibility needs, or similar considerations).

### 3. Henkaku Center and Graduate School of Design & Science (SDS)

<!--
Describe Henkaku Center and SDS as distinct but closely coupled entities.

Clarify that:
- Henkaku Center functions as a research and experimentation arm,
  supporting exploratory work, infrastructure, and cross-cutting initiatives.
- SDS functions as the academic arm, responsible for curriculum,
  degrees, and student learning.

State that faculty and students may participate in both contexts,
but that governance, accountability, and evaluation differ by role.
-->

### 4. Interaction, Flow, and Boundary Management

<!--
Describe how students, faculty, and researchers may move between
SDS and Henkaku Center contexts.

Emphasize that:
- Roles and expectations are context-dependent
- Authority does not automatically transfer across contexts
- Transparency and role clarity are required when operating across boundaries
-->

### 5. Affiliates, Visiting Researchers, and External Partners

<!--
Expectations for alignment with this Charter.
Rights and responsibilities of affiliation.
Norms for exit, disengagement, and dissociation.
-->

**Industry Integration**

This Charter encourages active collaboration with industry partners, including joint supervision of students shared between companies and the institution. Such arrangements recognize that:

- Real-world problems provide learning opportunities that purely academic settings cannot replicate
- Industry partners bring domain expertise, data, and constraints that enrich research and education
- Students benefit from exposure to professional practice before graduation
- Companies gain access to emerging talent and fresh perspectives

Joint supervision means genuine shared responsibility—industry partners participate in defining project scope, providing mentorship, and evaluating outcomes, not merely funding or hosting interns. Students in joint supervision arrangements have accountable mentors in both contexts.

**Expectations for External Partners**

External partners—whether industry collaborators, visiting researchers, or affiliates—are expected to operate consistently with Charter principles while engaged with Charter-covered programs. This includes:

- Respect for human primacy and accountability in AI-assisted work
- Commitment to intellectual integrity and transparency appropriate to the collaboration
- Recognition of student and researcher agency and development as goals, not merely deliverables
- Willingness to engage with the institution's cultural and methodological commitments

Alignment does not require agreement on all matters, but it does require good faith engagement with the principles articulated here. Partners who find Charter principles incompatible with their operations should seek collaboration elsewhere.

## VI. Governance and Stewardship

### 1. Stewardship of the Charter

<!--
Who may propose changes.
How changes are reviewed and evaluated.
Role of precedent and version history.
-->

### 2. Decision-Making Principles

<!--
When consensus is required.
When delegated authority is appropriate.
How disagreements and irreconcilable views are handled.
-->

Organizations covered by this Charter operate as **decentralized, horizontally-structured communities** where authority derives from commitment to execution rather than formal designation. This approach recognizes that coordination without rigid hierarchy requires explicit design.

**Horizontal Authority**

Authority and status are distributed rather than concentrated. Influence flows from demonstrated willingness to do work, not from positional power or informal designation. This creates legitimacy through action: those who commit time and effort to executing decisions earn authority to make them.

**Group Formation and Participation Pathways**

Working groups form through **explicit participation pathways** with clear execution commitments:

- **Open Invitations**: Opportunities to participate in initiatives should be made explicit, even when uptake is expected to be small. Visibility of participation pathways prevents later "who decided this?" dynamics and establishes that membership is tied to work, not status.

- **Self-Selection Through Commitment**: Invitations include specific time and execution requirements. This creates natural filtering—only those willing to do real work join, resulting in small, focused, accountable groups with clear legitimacy.

- **Work-Based Membership**: Membership in decision-making groups is earned through willingness to contribute, not granted through informal designation or social proximity. This ties authority directly to accountability.

- **Transparent Process**: Even if few people opt in, the existence of visible participation opportunities establishes fairness. Transparency in process supports small group size while maintaining legitimacy.

**Decision-Making in Practice**

Effective decision-making in horizontal structures balances focus with openness:

- **Small, Accountable Groups**: Decision-making groups should remain small, especially where subjective judgment is involved (design, tone, framing). Size is controlled through execution commitment requirements, not arbitrary closure.

- **Early Constraint Surfacing**: Openness early in processes helps surface technical, structural, and coordination constraints before decisions harden. This is particularly important when work has both subjective elements (design) and objective dimensions (architecture, maintenance, workflows).

- **Focused but Not Closed**: Working groups stay focused by requiring commitment, not by being invitation-only or informally constituted. The distinction is critical: focused execution with transparent access, rather than informal designation.

- **Preventing Drift**: Without explicit pathways and work-based membership, horizontal communities risk defaulting to informal power structures based on social proximity rather than contribution. Charter-governed organizations must actively design against this.

**Legitimacy and Accountability**

In decentralized settings, legitimacy requires:

1. **Transparent Opportunities**: Participation pathways must be visible, even if not widely taken up
2. **Commitment-Based Selection**: Authority tied to willingness to execute, not designation
3. **Small Group Execution**: Actual work done by focused teams with accountability
4. **Fair Process**: Openness in opportunity creation, focus in execution

This approach produces working groups that are both small (through self-selection) and legitimate (through transparent access), avoiding the coordination failures of both diffuse committees and closed informal networks.

### 3. Conflict, Accountability, and Repair

<!--
Processes for addressing harm or misconduct.
Distinction between personal conflict and institutional failure.

**Non-Antagonistic Engagement**

This Charter embraces a distinctive stance toward disagreement and change: engagement through invitation and demonstration rather than opposition and critique. This does not mean avoiding conflict or suppressing disagreement—it means choosing how to engage with difference.

Non-antagonistic engagement reflects several commitments:

- **Future-oriented optimism**: Energy directed toward building what should exist, rather than primarily attacking what currently does. Critique has its place, but construction is the primary mode.

- **Assuming good faith**: Beginning from the assumption that those who disagree may have legitimate reasons, different information, or different values—not that they are malicious or stupid. This assumption can be revised with evidence, but it is the starting point.

- **Invitation over coercion**: Change happens most durably when people choose it. Persuasion, demonstration, and creating attractive alternatives are preferred to force, shame, or exclusion. People who aren't ready to join aren't enemies.

- **Holding disagreement without rupture**: It is possible to disagree profoundly while maintaining relationship and mutual respect. Not every conflict requires resolution; some require only management. The goal is productive coexistence, not ideological uniformity.

This stance is not naivety or conflict avoidance. Some situations require direct confrontation; some actors operate in bad faith; some harms demand clear opposition. But antagonism as a *default mode*—treating disagreement as combat, seeking to defeat rather than persuade—is corrosive to the collaborative culture this Charter seeks to build.

The aim is a community that can hold difference, work through conflict, and emerge with relationships intact.
