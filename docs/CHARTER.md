# Charter

---

## Preamble

<!--
Purpose:
- State the scope and intent of this Charter.
- Specify who this Charter applies to (institutions, affiliates, researchers, collaborators).
- Clarify what this Charter is *not* (e.g., not a legal contract, not a policy manual, not branding).
-->

---

## I. Foundational Orientations

<!--
These conceptual orientations define the guiding ethos of the organizations
covered by this Charter in conceptual space. Each principle represents a
directional orientation along a contested axis—a deliberate choice about what
we prioritize.

These are not absolute rules but preferential tensions. "Resilience over
strength" does not reject strength, but signals that resilience is the primary
optimization target.
-->

**RESILIENCE** over strength.  
強さではなく、しなやかさを持つ。

**SYSTEMS** over objects.  
モノではなく、システムに焦点を合わせる。

**DISOBEDIENCE** over compliance.  
服従ではなく、反抗する。

**PULL** over push.  
「押す」のではなく、「引く」。

**COMPASSES** over maps.  
地図ではなく、良いコンパスを持つ。

**EMERGENCE** over authority.  
専門家ではなく、クラウド（人々）に向かう。

**RISK** over safety.  
安全ではなく、リスクを取る。

**PRACTICE** over theory.  
理論ではなく、実践に基づく。

**LEARNING** over education.  
教育ではなく、学びに焦点を当てる。

**SUSTAINABILITY** over growth.  
拡大ではなく、持続可能性。

**PUBLIC** over individuals.  
個人の利益ではなく、公共的な視点を持つこと。

**MODULAR** over monolithic.  
一枚岩ではなく、モジュール型のデザインを意識すること。

## II. Values and Commitments

### 1. Antidisciplinarity

<!--
Define antidisciplinarity.
Clarify how it differs from interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity.
Explain when disciplinary rigor is required and when it is intentionally suspended.
-->

### 2. Radical Transformation

<!--
Define “radical transformation” as structural, not cosmetic, change.
Clarify the difference between incremental improvement and transformation at the level of systems, institutions, and coordination mechanisms.
State that radical transformation is pursued deliberately, cautiously, and with awareness of second-order effects.
-->

### 3. Human and Artificial Intelligence

<!--
This section establishes how human and artificial intelligence interact
within the scope of this Charter.

Key principles to articulate here:

- Artificial intelligence systems do not possess moral, legal, or institutional agency.
  They may act within defined workflows, but they do not bear responsibility or authority.
- Human agency may be amplified through computational and agentic systems,
  but it may not be transferred or abdicated.
- Every decision, action, or outcome produced with the assistance of AI
  must have a clear and identifiable line of human accountability.
- Agentic workflows are treated as designed coordination systems,
  including their interfaces, constraints, feedback loops, and escalation paths.
- As system autonomy increases, requirements for oversight, legibility,
  auditability, and intervention increase proportionally.

Ambiguity of responsibility in human–machine systems is considered a
design failure and must be addressed through governance, tooling, or process.
-->

### 4. Intellectual Integrity

<!--
Commitments to truth-seeking, clarity, and rigor.
Distinguish speculation, research, and deployment.
-->

### 5. Experimentation and Risk

<!--
Legitimacy of experimentation and failure.
Boundaries on experimentation involving people, institutions, or public trust.
-->

### 6. Cultural and Contextual Respect

<!--
Role of Japanese cultural context as a constraint and resource.
Approach to global collaboration without cultural flattening.
-->

**Neurodiversity and Cognitive Difference**

This Charter explicitly acknowledges and respects **neurodiversity**—the natural variation in human cognition, perception, and interaction. We recognize that people think, feel, learn, and collaborate in fundamentally different ways, and that these differences are sources of strength rather than deficits to be corrected.

Respect for neurodiversity means:

- **Valuing different modes of thinking**: Analytical, intuitive, visual, verbal, linear, associative—different cognitive styles contribute different capabilities. Environments and processes should not implicitly privilege one mode over others.

- **Accommodating different modes of feeling**: Emotional expression, sensory sensitivity, and social energy vary widely. Expectations around interaction, presence, and communication should allow for this variation rather than enforcing a single norm.

- **Supporting different modes of collaborating**: Some people thrive in spontaneous discussion; others need time to process before contributing. Some prefer written communication; others prefer verbal. Collaboration structures should create multiple pathways for meaningful participation.

- **Designing for flexibility**: Physical spaces, meeting formats, communication channels, and work rhythms should be designed with variation in mind—not as afterthought accommodations, but as fundamental assumptions.

- **Making the implicit explicit**: Many people—particularly those on the autism spectrum—thrive when expectations, norms, and "rules of the game" are stated directly rather than left to inference. Environments that require participants to guess at unstated expectations, read between the lines, or navigate unspoken social dynamics create unnecessary barriers. Clear communication about what is expected, what is valued, and how decisions are made benefits everyone and is essential for some.

This commitment extends beyond formal disability accommodation. It reflects a recognition that the full range of human cognitive diversity—including but not limited to autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and other neurological differences—brings perspectives and capabilities that homogeneous environments cannot produce. Explicit norms and direct communication are not merely accommodations—they are better design.

### 7. Openness with Discernment

<!--
When openness and transparency are required.
When discretion or confidentiality is necessary.
Tradeoffs between transparency and potential harm.
-->

### 8. Human Primacy and Responsibility

<!--
Assert that authority, accountability, and legitimacy are irreducibly human.
Clarify roles of individuals vs institutions.
Explicitly state limits on delegation to computational or automated systems.
-->

### 9. Coordination as a Design Problem

<!--
Frame coordination as a first-order object of inquiry.
Explain why institutions, processes, and incentives must be designed.
Identify common coordination failure modes this ecosystem seeks to avoid.
-->

---

## III. Research Practice

### 1. Project-Centered Inquiry

<!--
Define projects as the unit of research inquiry.
Criteria for a legitimate research project.
Project lifecycle: initiation, evolution, completion, and archival.
Relationship between research projects and academic outputs.
-->

### 2. Project Registry and Coordination Infrastructure

Organizations covered by this Charter must establish and maintain a **project registry**—a shared platform for defining, submitting, and browsing active projects and initiatives.

The registry serves as coordination infrastructure, making work visible and enabling participants to identify connections, gaps, and conflicts across the ecosystem.

**Projects as Bounded Units of Transformation**: Projects are distinguished from open-ended research programs or permanent organizational functions by their finite, mission-driven nature. Every project must articulate not only what it aims to achieve, but also what would make it complete.

#### Requirements

**Project Definition Template**: Each project submission must articulate:

- **Intent**: What specific situation, breakdown, or opportunity this project addresses, what transformation is being pursued, and why. This includes both the motivating problem and the intended outcome.

- **Scope**: Boundaries of the project—what it includes and excludes, what it will build or measure or change, and what outputs it will produce. Clear scope prevents indefinite expansion and enables evaluation of completeness.

- **Temporal Bounds**: When the project begins, when it is expected to complete, and key milestones along the way. Projects must be time-bounded to maintain focus and accountability.

- **Measurability and Completion**: How impact or progress will be assessed (whether qualitatively or quantitatively), and what specific evidence would indicate success or failure. Projects must also state what would make the work complete—not just successful, but done.

- **Participants**: Who has authority, accountability, and contribution roles. This includes project ownership (who is responsible for delivery) and contributors (who supports the work and in what capacity).

- **Dependencies**: What this project requires from other efforts, and what other efforts depend on this project. Dependencies make coordination visible and help identify critical paths and bottlenecks.

- **Status**: Current state (proposed, active, paused, completed, archived). Status enables tracking project progression through its lifecycle.

- **Resources** (where applicable): Funding sources, resource allocation, and budgeted areas. Financial and material accountability supports transparency and coordination.

**Measurability with Forgiveness**: Projects must articulate how outcomes will be evaluated, but the Charter recognizes that some impacts—especially systemic, cultural, or long-term transformations—resist clean measurement.

Projects should state *what would count as evidence of success or failure*, even if that evidence cannot be fully quantified. Unmeasurable does not mean unevaluable. Qualitative assessment, stakeholder feedback, and narrative evaluation are legitimate forms of measurement.

**Overlap and Coherence Analysis**: The platform must support participants in:
- Identifying **overlapping scope** between projects (potential redundancy or collaboration opportunity)
- Recognizing **distinctiveness** (how projects differ in approach, method, or aim)
- Surfacing **incoherence** (where projects pursue conflicting goals or undermine each other)

This analysis may be manual, computational, or hybrid, but it must be legible and actionable.

#### Governance

- The registry is a **coordination tool**, not an approval mechanism. Projects do not require permission to be listed, but listing signals accountability to Charter principles.
- The registry does not replace formal institutional processes (course approvals, research ethics review, funding applications). It complements them.
- Projects that violate Charter principles may be flagged for review, but the registry itself does not have enforcement authority.

#### Implementation

- The platform must be accessible to all participants covered by this Charter.
- The template may evolve through governance processes (Section VI), but changes must preserve backward compatibility or provide migration paths for existing entries.
- The platform should lower barriers to entry while maintaining clarity—favoring lightweight initial submissions that can be refined over time.
- Implementations should provide guidance and prompts that help project authors meet these requirements without imposing unnecessary bureaucracy.

## IV. Educational Practice

### 1. Project-Centered Learning

<!--
Define projects as the unit of learning and pedagogy.
Criteria for a legitimate educational project.
Relationship between learning projects and academic assessment.
Student agency and ownership in project selection and execution.
-->

### 2. Learning Through Making and Doing

<!--
Role of prototypes, artifacts, simulations, and interventions in education.
Expectation of reflection, documentation, and learning capture.
Integration of theory and practice in project-based learning.
-->

### 3. Use of Computational and Agentic Systems

<!--
AI and agentic systems as tools within human-led workflows (research and education).
Explicit prohibitions on delegating authority or accountability.
Requirements for legibility, auditability, and oversight.
Role of AI in augmenting but not replacing human learning and inquiry.
-->

Educational programs covered by this Charter integrate AI as a foundational assumption, not an optional enhancement. Students must learn to work effectively with AI tools while developing capacities that remain uniquely human.

**Two Complementary Pillars**:

**Teaching AI** — Students develop judgment and workflow literacy that transfers across tools:
- **Effective AI Workflows**: Environments that support thinking rather than replacing it, creating natural checkpoints for reflection and making students more thoughtful, not just faster
- **Sustained Projects**: Strategies for managing extended work—maintaining plans, preserving context across sessions, and keeping AI collaborators aligned with evolving objectives
- **Security and Privacy**: Understanding data flows, handling sensitive information, recognizing manipulation vectors, and operational security awareness
- **Human Collaboration**: AI as part of broader collaborative environments, facilitating shared context, handoffs, and asynchronous work with other people

**Teaching with AI** — Using AI as a medium through which students develop genuine conceptual understanding:
- **Problem Posing over Problem Solving**: While AI systems solve problems, humans remain essential for identifying what's worth solving, framing ambiguous situations, and recognizing when solutions address real needs. Education shifts toward developing these problem-posing abilities.
- **Assessment of Judgment**: Evaluation focuses not on answer correctness but on problem framing, approach appropriateness, error identification in AI outputs, and meaningful improvements upon AI-generated solutions. Assessment evaluates questions and judgment, not just answers.
- **Designing for Uncertainty**: Rather than assignments built around current AI limitations, develop students' capacity to work productively with AI systems of any capability level. The core question remains: what uniquely human contributions are valuable, and how do we develop students' ability to make them?

**Implementation Requirements**:
- AI integration is not optional—students and faculty are already using these tools
- Learning experiences must remain meaningful when students have access to powerful AI collaborators
- Assessment must distinguish between human judgment and AI execution
- Privacy and security awareness must be taught explicitly and reinforced continuously

---

## V. Institutional Relationships

This section articulates how the Charter understands and governs relationships among participating institutions. These relationships are not assumed to be flat or symmetrical. Instead, they are treated as **explicitly designed interfaces** between organizations with different mandates, tempos, and constraints.

The aim is not to dissolve institutional boundaries, but to enable **productive coupling** across them—preserving accountability, authority, and trust while allowing for experimentation and collaboration.

### 1. Roles and Positions

The ecosystem covered by this Charter comprises individuals in the following broad categories:

**Director** — Executive leadership with strategic and operational authority over one or more institutional units (Henkaku Center, SDS, or designated programs). Directors bear ultimate accountability for organizational direction, resource allocation, and alignment with Charter principles.

**Faculty** — Members holding academic appointments within SDS, responsible for curriculum, student mentorship, and degree program integrity. Faculty simultaneously function as **Principal Researchers**, leading research initiatives and bearing accountability for research outcomes. This dual role reflects the Charter's commitment to integrating education and research practice.

**Principal Researchers** — Individuals who lead and bear accountability for research projects, whether or not they hold faculty appointments. Principal researchers are responsible for project design, execution, and outcomes within their domains.

**Researchers** — Individuals engaged in research activities under the guidance of principal researchers or faculty. Researchers contribute to project execution but do not bear primary accountability for project-level decisions.

**Staff** — Individuals providing operational, administrative, or technical support. Staff enable the functioning of research and educational programs without bearing direct academic or research accountability.

**Visiting Researchers** — Individuals temporarily affiliated with the ecosystem for research purposes, typically maintaining primary appointments elsewhere. Visiting researchers operate under the guidance of a faculty member or principal researcher who serves as their institutional liaison.

**Affiliates** — Individuals with formal but non-employment relationships to the ecosystem—including adjunct faculty, advisors, collaborators, and partners. Affiliates may participate in research, education, or governance according to the terms of their affiliation.

These categories are not mutually exclusive beyond the structural constraints noted above. Individuals may hold multiple roles, and role boundaries may evolve as the ecosystem matures. What matters is clarity: at any given moment, for any given activity, individuals should be able to identify which role they occupy and what accountability that role entails.

### 2. Chiba Institute of Technology (Host Institution)

<!--
Describe Chiba Tech as the host institution that provides legal standing,
infrastructure, and long-term continuity.

Acknowledge that while Chiba Tech is forward-looking, it necessarily
operates under constraints of scale, regulation, and tradition.

State that antidisciplinary and experimental work is pursued within
these constraints, not in opposition to them.
-->

**Physical Presence and Campus Integration**

In-person activities of the Henkaku Center and SDS should be primarily based at the **Chiba Institute of Technology Tsudanuma Campus**. This expectation reflects several commitments:

- **Institutional integration**: Physical presence on campus reinforces that Henkaku Center and SDS are part of Chiba Tech, not separate entities that happen to share an affiliation. Visibility and proximity support collaboration with the broader university community.

- **Shared infrastructure**: Tsudanuma Campus provides facilities, services, and administrative support that enable research and education. Making use of this infrastructure honors the relationship with the host institution.

- **Community formation**: Regular physical co-presence builds relationships, trust, and informal knowledge exchange that remote interaction cannot fully replicate.

Off-campus events, external venue meetings, and remote participation are permissible and sometimes necessary. However, good faith effort should be made to hold activities at Tsudanuma whenever reasonably possible. The default assumption is on-campus presence; departures from this default should have clear justification (venue requirements, partner convenience, accessibility needs, or similar considerations).

### 3. Henkaku Center and Graduate School of Design & Science (SDS)

<!--
Describe Henkaku Center and SDS as distinct but closely coupled entities.

Clarify that:
- Henkaku Center functions as a research and experimentation arm,
  supporting exploratory work, infrastructure, and cross-cutting initiatives.
- SDS functions as the academic arm, responsible for curriculum,
  degrees, and student learning.

State that faculty and students may participate in both contexts,
but that governance, accountability, and evaluation differ by role.
-->

### 4. Interaction, Flow, and Boundary Management

<!--
Describe how students, faculty, and researchers may move between
SDS and Henkaku Center contexts.

Emphasize that:
- Roles and expectations are context-dependent
- Authority does not automatically transfer across contexts
- Transparency and role clarity are required when operating across boundaries
-->

### 5. Affiliates, Visiting Researchers, and External Partners

<!--
Expectations for alignment with this Charter.
Rights and responsibilities of affiliation.
Norms for exit, disengagement, and dissociation.
-->

## VI. Governance and Stewardship

### 1. Stewardship of the Charter

<!--
Who may propose changes.
How changes are reviewed and evaluated.
Role of precedent and version history.
-->

### 2. Decision-Making Principles

<!--
When consensus is required.
When delegated authority is appropriate.
How disagreements and irreconcilable views are handled.
-->

Organizations covered by this Charter operate as **decentralized, horizontally-structured communities** where authority derives from commitment to execution rather than formal designation. This approach recognizes that coordination without rigid hierarchy requires explicit design.

**Horizontal Authority**

Authority and status are distributed rather than concentrated. Influence flows from demonstrated willingness to do work, not from positional power or informal designation. This creates legitimacy through action: those who commit time and effort to executing decisions earn authority to make them.

**Group Formation and Participation Pathways**

Working groups form through **explicit participation pathways** with clear execution commitments:

- **Open Invitations**: Opportunities to participate in initiatives should be made explicit, even when uptake is expected to be small. Visibility of participation pathways prevents later "who decided this?" dynamics and establishes that membership is tied to work, not status.

- **Self-Selection Through Commitment**: Invitations include specific time and execution requirements. This creates natural filtering—only those willing to do real work join, resulting in small, focused, accountable groups with clear legitimacy.

- **Work-Based Membership**: Membership in decision-making groups is earned through willingness to contribute, not granted through informal designation or social proximity. This ties authority directly to accountability.

- **Transparent Process**: Even if few people opt in, the existence of visible participation opportunities establishes fairness. Transparency in process supports small group size while maintaining legitimacy.

**Decision-Making in Practice**

Effective decision-making in horizontal structures balances focus with openness:

- **Small, Accountable Groups**: Decision-making groups should remain small, especially where subjective judgment is involved (design, tone, framing). Size is controlled through execution commitment requirements, not arbitrary closure.

- **Early Constraint Surfacing**: Openness early in processes helps surface technical, structural, and coordination constraints before decisions harden. This is particularly important when work has both subjective elements (design) and objective dimensions (architecture, maintenance, workflows).

- **Focused but Not Closed**: Working groups stay focused by requiring commitment, not by being invitation-only or informally constituted. The distinction is critical: focused execution with transparent access, rather than informal designation.

- **Preventing Drift**: Without explicit pathways and work-based membership, horizontal communities risk defaulting to informal power structures based on social proximity rather than contribution. Charter-governed organizations must actively design against this.

**Legitimacy and Accountability**

In decentralized settings, legitimacy requires:

1. **Transparent Opportunities**: Participation pathways must be visible, even if not widely taken up
2. **Commitment-Based Selection**: Authority tied to willingness to execute, not designation
3. **Small Group Execution**: Actual work done by focused teams with accountability
4. **Fair Process**: Openness in opportunity creation, focus in execution

This approach produces working groups that are both small (through self-selection) and legitimate (through transparent access), avoiding the coordination failures of both diffuse committees and closed informal networks.
