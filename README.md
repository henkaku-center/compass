# Compass

**Compass** makes shared values and ongoing work visible and easy to contribute to — coordination infrastructure for the [Henkaku Center](https://henkaku.center), [Graduate School of Design & Science (SDS)](https://sds.chibatech.dev), and [Chiba Institute of Technology](https://chibatech.jp/).

Unlike traditional institutional documents created as static artifacts, Compass treats governance as an evolving system: maintained under version control, updated through transparent review, and designed for long-term coherence without rigid hierarchy.

## Purpose

Compass exists to:

1. **Make work visible** — Surface who is doing what, how projects and initiatives connect, and where gaps or overlaps exist
2. **Lower the barrier to contribution** — Provide clear pathways so that anyone in the ecosystem can propose changes, not just those comfortable with technical tooling
3. **Anchor values over time** — Provide a stable set of principles that persist even as people, projects, and structures change
4. **Enable antidisciplinary work** — Support collaboration across disciplines by focusing on paradigms, systems, and shared purpose

## Structure

Compass documents are organized into two layers:

### DNA

Foundational documents that define principles, governance, and structural templates.

- **[Charter](https://charter.henkaku.center)** — Values, governance principles, and operational commitments across 9 sections (hosted externally)
- **Archetypes** — Structural templates for seven registry entry types: people, projects, initiatives, courses, theses, events, and institutions

### Emergent

Living content instantiated from those templates.

- **Curriculum** — SDS Master's and PhD programs launching April 2026

As the ecosystem grows, this layer will expand to include populated directories of people, projects, initiatives, theses, events, and institutions.

### Other Information

- **References** — Source documents and historical materials
- **History** — Commit history pulled from the GitHub repository, grouped by date with contributor, type, and memo columns
- **Status** — Progress updates on Compass development
- **About** — This page

All documents are available via the [website](https://compass.henkaku.org) or in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/henkaku-center/compass).

## Origin and Institutional Context

Compass is developed and stewarded by researchers affiliated with **Chiba Tech**, the **Henkaku Center for Radical Transformation**, and the **Graduate School of Design & Science (SDS)**.

### Chiba Institute of Technology (Chiba Tech)

The oldest private technology institute in Japan, established in 1942. Today, Chiba Tech balances respect for tradition with forward-looking imagination, entering a new chapter as a hub for advanced technology education under Joi Ito's leadership.

### Graduate School of Design & Science (SDS)

A new graduate school launching in April 2026. SDS brings together engineers, designers, artists, and scientists in a project-based learning environment focused on solving complex, real-world problems. Core elements include antidisciplinary collaboration, engagement with agentic AI, and the integration of Japanese aesthetics into contemporary technological practice.

### Henkaku Center for Radical Transformation

A research center within Chiba Tech that provides shared infrastructure and connective tissue across education, research, and policy initiatives. The Center supports experimental programs, institutional prototyping, and cross-cutting initiatives that explore new models of coordination, governance, and social impact.

### Compass Initiative

Based in Henkaku Center, the **Compass Initiative** is an umbrella effort to design and experiment with radical coordination technology — tools, frameworks, and practices that help groups align, make decisions, and evolve together without defaulting to rigid hierarchy or static rules.

The name "Compass" is an homage to the guiding principle **"Compasses over Maps"** — the conviction that navigating uncertainty requires directional orientation and adaptive judgment, not fixed routes or predetermined destinations.

Within this context, the Charter serves as both a concrete institutional artifact and a prototype for how foundational documents themselves can be collaboratively governed.
