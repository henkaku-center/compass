# Antidisciplinary Charter

This repository contains the **Antidisciplinary Charter** — a version‑controlled, *living document* that articulates foundational values, governance principles, and operational practices for organizing and coordinating across institutions, affiliations, disciplines, and modes of impact.

Unlike traditional charters or constitutive documents, which are typically created as static artifacts (for example, a finalized PDF), this project treats the Charter as an evolving system: maintained under version control, updated through transparent review, and designed to support long‑term institutional coherence without rigid hierarchy.

The Antidisciplinary Charter is designed as:

- A **living document**, maintained in Markdown and tracked under version control
- A text that evolves through **transparent, peer‑reviewed contributions**
- A shared reference point that encodes values, principles, and process rather than fixed outcomes

In addition, the Charter’s infrastructure is being designed with **agentic workflows** in mind. This includes anticipating AI agents as **integrated components of the contribution infrastructure**, supporting drafting, analysis, review, and reasoning about proposed changes, while authority, accountability, and final decision-making remain explicitly human.

## Why a Charter?

The Charter exists to:

1. **Anchor values over time**  
   Provide a stable set of principles that persist even as people, projects, and structures change.

2. **Enable antidisciplinary work**  
   Support collaboration across disciplines by focusing on paradigms, systems, and shared purpose rather than domain‑specific authority.

3. **Reduce reliance on centralized control**  
   Align participants through shared reference points instead of top‑down directives.

4. **Make institutional drift visible**  
   Offer a clear standard against which future decisions and changes can be evaluated.

## Beyond a Static Document

In parallel with the text itself, this repository is intended to support experimentation with **consensus and contribution mechanisms** for foundational documents.

As described informally during early discussions:

> We’re developing the features and form of a living document of shared principles (“The Charter”), as well as a digital consensus mechanism for making changes and keeping it up to date. Rather than a static PDF artifact, this becomes a version‑controlled document where member contributions are peer‑reviewed and tracked, potentially approved through lightweight, point‑based or reputation‑based systems.  
> If done well, this approach could inform broader consensus architectures for other documents and processes that benefit from community review, including those mediated or partially automated by agentic systems operating under clearly defined constraints.

Over time, this repository may therefore include not only the Charter text, but also tooling, workflows, and experiments related to collaborative governance.

## How to Use This Repository

- **Read** the Charter to understand its principles, process, and scope.
- **Track changes** through version history to see how the document evolves.
- **Propose revisions** via pull requests or other contribution mechanisms as defined in this repo.
- **Reuse or adapt** the Charter for other contexts where antidisciplinary or paradigm‑level coordination is desired.

## Attribution and Institutional Context

The Antidisciplinary Charter is developed and stewarded by researchers affiliated with **Chiba Tech**, the **Henkaku Center for Radical Transformation**, and the **Graduate School of Design & Science (SDS)**, as part of the **Henkaku Compass Initiative**.

### Chiba Institute of Technology (Chiba Tech)

The **Chiba Institute of Technology (Chiba Tech)** is the oldest private technology institute in Japan. Established in 1942 as the *Kōa Institute of Technology*—with “Kōa” meaning “Asia wakes up”—the school emerged from a historical moment oriented toward technological advancement and regional ambition.

Today, Chiba Tech balances respect for tradition with forward-looking imagination. Its culture reflects both pride in Japanese heritage and a principled design philosophy oriented toward innovation and experimentation. As Chiba Tech enters a new chapter as a hub for advanced technology education under Joi Ito’s leadership, its evolving identity serves as both a celebration of legacy and an articulation of future ambition.

### Graduate School of Design & Science (SDS)

The **Graduate School of Design & Science (SDS)** is a new graduate school launching in April 2026. SDS brings together engineers, designers, artists, and scientists in a project-based learning environment focused on solving complex, real-world problems.

Core elements of the SDS curriculum include antidisciplinary collaboration, engagement with agentic AI as part of the creative and analytical workflow, and the integration of Japanese aesthetics and cultural context into contemporary technological practice.

### Henkaku Center for Radical Transformation

The **Henkaku Center for Radical Transformation** is a research center within Chiba Tech that provides shared infrastructure and connective tissue across education, research, and policy initiatives.

The Center supports experimental programs, institutional prototyping, and cross-cutting initiatives—such as the Henkaku Compass Initiative—that explore new models of coordination, governance, and social impact.

### The Henkaku Compass Initiative

Based in Henkaku Center, The **Henkaku Compass Initiative** is an umbrella effort to design and experiment with **radical coordination technology** — tools, frameworks, and practices that help groups align, make decisions, and evolve together without defaulting to rigid hierarchy or static rules.

The Initiative explores questions such as:

- How can institutions maintain coherence while remaining adaptive?
- How can shared values be encoded without over‑prescription?
- How can governance processes remain transparent, legible, and participatory at scale?

Within this context, the Antidisciplinary Charter serves as both:
- A concrete institutional artifact, and
- A prototype for how foundational documents themselves can be collaboratively governed.

While these institutions provide the originating context and ongoing stewardship, the Charter itself is intended to be reusable, adaptable, and extensible across other organizational and institutional settings.

## Status

This project is intentionally evolving. Some structures and processes described here may be aspirational or under active development. The Charter itself should be treated as authoritative regarding values and intent, even as its form and governance mechanisms continue to mature.
