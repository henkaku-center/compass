# Antidisciplinary Charter

This repository contains the **Antidisciplinary Charter** — a version‑controlled, *living document* that articulates the foundational values, governance principles, and operational practices for organizing and coordinating across disciplines.

The Charter is a project of the **Henkaku Compass Initiative**, an effort focused on building *coordination technology*: systems and mechanisms that support effective human cooperation, collective action, and transparent governance in complex social and institutional contexts.

## What Is This Project?

Traditional charters and constitutive documents are typically created as static artifacts (for example, a finalized PDF). This project takes a different approach.

The Antidisciplinary Charter is designed as:

- A **living document**, maintained in Markdown and tracked under version control
- A text that evolves through **transparent, peer‑reviewed contributions**
- A shared reference point that encodes values, principles, and process rather than fixed outcomes

Rather than relying on a single author or centralized authority, the Charter is intended to be collectively stewarded over time.

## The Henkaku Compass Initiative

The **Henkaku Compass Initiative** is an umbrella effort to design and experiment with **coordination technology** — tools, frameworks, and practices that help groups align, make decisions, and evolve together without defaulting to rigid hierarchy or static rules.

The Initiative explores questions such as:

- How can institutions maintain coherence while remaining adaptive?
- How can shared values be encoded without over‑prescription?
- How can governance processes remain transparent, legible, and participatory at scale?

Within this context, the Antidisciplinary Charter serves as both:
- A concrete institutional artifact, and
- A prototype for how foundational documents themselves can be collaboratively governed.

## Why a Charter?

The Charter exists to:

1. **Anchor values over time**  
   Provide a stable set of principles that persist even as people, projects, and structures change.

2. **Enable antidisciplinary work**  
   Support collaboration across disciplines by focusing on paradigms, systems, and shared purpose rather than domain‑specific authority.

3. **Reduce reliance on centralized control**  
   Align participants through shared reference points instead of top‑down directives.

4. **Make institutional drift visible**  
   Offer a clear standard against which future decisions and changes can be evaluated.

## Beyond a Static Document

In parallel with the text itself, this repository is intended to support experimentation with **consensus and contribution mechanisms** for foundational documents.

As described informally during early discussions:

> We’re developing the features and form of a living document of shared principles (“The Charter”), as well as a digital consensus mechanism for making changes and keeping it up to date. Rather than a static PDF artifact, this becomes a version‑controlled document where member contributions are peer‑reviewed and tracked, potentially approved through lightweight, point‑based or reputation‑based systems. If done well, this approach could inform broader consensus architectures for other documents and processes that benefit from community review.

Over time, this repository may therefore include not only the Charter text, but also tooling, workflows, and experiments related to collaborative governance.

## How to Use This Repository

- **Read** the Charter to understand its principles, process, and scope.
- **Track changes** through version history to see how the document evolves.
- **Propose revisions** via pull requests or other contribution mechanisms as defined in this repo.
- **Reuse or adapt** the Charter for other contexts where antidisciplinary or paradigm‑level coordination is desired.

## Status

This project is intentionally evolving. Some structures and processes described here may be aspirational or under active development. The Charter itself should be treated as authoritative regarding values and intent, even as its form and governance mechanisms continue to mature.
