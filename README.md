# Compass

**Compass** makes shared values and ongoing work visible and easy to contribute to — coordination infrastructure for the [Henkaku Center](https://henkaku.center), [Graduate School of Design & Science (SDS)](https://sds.chibatech.dev), and [Chiba Institute of Technology](https://chibatech.jp/).

Unlike traditional institutional documents created as static artifacts, Compass treats governance as an evolving system: maintained under version control, updated through transparent review, and designed for long-term coherence without rigid hierarchy.

## Purpose

Compass exists to:

1. **Make work visible** — Surface who is doing what, how projects and initiatives connect, and where gaps or overlaps exist
2. **Lower the barrier to contribution** — Provide clear pathways so that anyone in the ecosystem can propose changes, not just those comfortable with technical tooling
3. **Anchor values over time** — Provide a stable set of principles that persist even as people, projects, and structures change
4. **Enable antidisciplinary work** — Support collaboration across disciplines by focusing on paradigms, systems, and shared purpose
5. **Make institutional drift visible** — Track how decisions evolve, so that changes to principles are traceable and auditable rather than silent

## Structure

Compass documents are organized into two layers:

### DNA

Foundational documents that define principles, governance, and structural templates.

- **Charter** — Values, governance principles, and operational commitments across 9 sections
- **Archetypes** — Structural templates for six registry entry types: people, projects, initiatives, courses, theses, and events

### Emergent

Living content instantiated from those templates.

- **Curriculum** — SDS Master's and PhD programs launching April 2026

As the ecosystem grows, this layer will expand to include populated directories of people, projects, initiatives, theses, and events.

### Supporting

- **References** — Source documents and historical materials
- **History** — Commit history pulled from the GitHub repository, grouped by date with contributor, type, and memo columns
- **Status** — Progress updates on Compass development
- **About** — This page

All documents are available via the [website](https://compass.henkaku.org) or in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/henkaku-center/compass).

## Agentic Workflows

Compass is developed with agentic workflows as a first-class concern:

- **Built with agents** — The project itself is developed using LLM coding agents that draft, edit, and coordinate content under human direction
- **Agent-assisted contribution** — Contributors are expected to work with coding agents when proposing amendments, reviews, and revisions
- **Agentic interfaces** — Intermediate agents — such as chat bots or Slack integrations — will provide contributors pathways to interact with Compass without requiring direct repository access

Authority, accountability, and final decision-making remain explicitly human throughout.

## Governance and Evolution

In parallel with the Charter text itself, Compass supports experimentation with consensus and contribution mechanisms for foundational documents.

> We're developing the features and form of a living document of shared principles ("The Charter"), as well as a digital consensus mechanism for making changes and keeping it up to date. Rather than a static PDF artifact, this becomes a version-controlled document where member contributions are peer-reviewed and tracked, potentially approved through lightweight, point-based or reputation-based systems.

Over time, the project may include not only the Charter text, but also tooling, workflows, and experiments related to collaborative governance — including agent-mediated interfaces that translate contributor intent into structured pull requests.

## Origin and Institutional Context

Compass is developed and stewarded by researchers affiliated with **Chiba Tech**, the **Henkaku Center for Radical Transformation**, and the **Graduate School of Design & Science (SDS)**.

### Chiba Institute of Technology (Chiba Tech)

The oldest private technology institute in Japan, established in 1942. Today, Chiba Tech balances respect for tradition with forward-looking imagination, entering a new chapter as a hub for advanced technology education under Joi Ito's leadership.

### Graduate School of Design & Science (SDS)

A new graduate school launching in April 2026. SDS brings together engineers, designers, artists, and scientists in a project-based learning environment focused on solving complex, real-world problems. Core elements include antidisciplinary collaboration, engagement with agentic AI, and the integration of Japanese aesthetics into contemporary technological practice.

### Henkaku Center for Radical Transformation

A research center within Chiba Tech that provides shared infrastructure and connective tissue across education, research, and policy initiatives. The Center supports experimental programs, institutional prototyping, and cross-cutting initiatives that explore new models of coordination, governance, and social impact.

### Compass Initiative

Based in Henkaku Center, the **Compass Initiative** is an umbrella effort to design and experiment with radical coordination technology — tools, frameworks, and practices that help groups align, make decisions, and evolve together without defaulting to rigid hierarchy or static rules.

The name "Compass" is an homage to the guiding principle **"Compasses over Maps"** — the conviction that navigating uncertainty requires directional orientation and adaptive judgment, not fixed routes or predetermined destinations.

Within this context, the Charter serves as both a concrete institutional artifact and a prototype for how foundational documents themselves can be collaboratively governed.

## Engagement

- **Read** the Charter to understand the principles, process, and scope
- **Track changes** through the [History page](https://compass.henkaku.center/#history) or [GitHub commits](https://github.com/henkaku-center/compass/commits/main) to see how documents evolve
- **Define entries** using the Archetypes templates for people, projects, initiatives, courses, theses, and events
- **Propose revisions** via [pull requests](https://github.com/henkaku-center/compass/pulls), agent-assisted workflows, or agentic interfaces
- **Reuse or adapt** the Charter for other contexts where antidisciplinary coordination is desired

## Maturity

This project is intentionally evolving. Some structures and processes described here may be aspirational or under active development. The Charter should be treated as authoritative regarding values and intent, even as its form and governance mechanisms continue to mature.
