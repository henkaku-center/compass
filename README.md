# Compass

> **Viewing on the web?** This site renders content from the [Compass GitHub repository](https://github.com/henkaku-center/compass). The source files are version-controlled Markdown documents that you can also browse, fork, or contribute to on GitHub.

**Compass** articulates foundational values, governance principles, and operational practices for the Henkaku Center, Graduate School of Design & Science (SDS), and Chiba Institute of Technology.

Compass includes:

- **Charter** — The foundational governance document articulating values, principles, and operational commitments
- **Registry Schema** — Structured templates for tracking people, projects, and initiatives
- **Curriculum** — Documentation of SDS Master's and PhD programs
- **Reference Materials** — Source documents and historical versions

Unlike traditional institutional documents created as static artifacts (PDFs archived and forgotten), Compass treats governance as an evolving system: maintained under version control, updated through transparent review, and designed for long‑term coherence without rigid hierarchy.

The infrastructure is designed with **agentic workflows** in mind—AI agents as integrated components supporting drafting, analysis, and review, while authority, accountability, and final decision-making remain explicitly human.

## Purpose and Motivation

Compass exists to:

1. **Anchor values over time**  
   Provide a stable set of principles that persist even as people, projects, and structures change.

2. **Enable antidisciplinary work**  
   Support collaboration across disciplines by focusing on paradigms, systems, and shared purpose rather than domain‑specific authority.

3. **Reduce reliance on centralized control**  
   Align participants through shared reference points instead of top‑down directives.

4. **Make institutional drift visible**  
   Offer a clear standard against which future decisions and changes can be evaluated.

## Governance and Evolution

In parallel with the Charter text itself, this project supports experimentation with **consensus and contribution mechanisms** for foundational documents.

As described informally during early discussions:

> We’re developing the features and form of a living document of shared principles (“The Charter”), as well as a digital consensus mechanism for making changes and keeping it up to date. Rather than a static PDF artifact, this becomes a version‑controlled document where member contributions are peer‑reviewed and tracked, potentially approved through lightweight, point‑based or reputation‑based systems.  
> If done well, this approach could inform broader consensus architectures for other documents and processes that benefit from community review, including those mediated or partially automated by agentic systems operating under clearly defined constraints.

Over time, the project may therefore include not only the Charter text, but also tooling, workflows, and experiments related to collaborative governance.

## Documents and Structure

Compass includes the following documents (all available via the navigation above or in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/henkaku-center/compass)):

- **Charter** — The primary governance document articulating values and operational commitments
- **Registry Schema** — Unified schema for people, projects, and initiatives registry
- **Curriculum** — SDS Master's and PhD curriculum with course listings
- **Status** — Progress updates on Compass development
- **References** — Source documents and historical versions available for download

Additional files in the repository:
- `CLAUDE.md` — Documentation for AI assistants working with Compass

### Key Documents

The Charter establishes principles and infrastructure for coordination, including:

- **Section III.2: Registry and Coordination Infrastructure** - Mandates a shared platform for defining and browsing people, projects, and initiatives across the ecosystem.

The **Registry Schema** (`docs/REGISTRY_SCHEMA.md`) implements these requirements with structured templates for three entry types:
- **People**: Who they are, what expertise they bring, what they're working on
- **Projects**: Bounded endeavors with completion criteria and measurable outcomes
- **Initiatives**: Ongoing programs evaluated on continuing justification

The **Curriculum** (`docs/CURRICULUM.md`) documents the SDS Master's and PhD programs launching April 2026.

## Engagement and Use

- **Read** the Charter to understand the principles, process, and scope
- **Track changes** through [version history on GitHub](https://github.com/henkaku-center/compass/commits/main) to see how documents evolve
- **Define registry entries** using the Registry Schema templates for people, projects, and initiatives
- **Propose revisions** via [pull requests](https://github.com/henkaku-center/compass/pulls) or other contribution mechanisms
- **Reuse or adapt** the Charter for other contexts where antidisciplinary or paradigm‑level coordination is desired

## Origin, Stewardship, and Institutional Context

Compass is developed and stewarded by researchers affiliated with **Chiba Tech**, the **Henkaku Center for Radical Transformation**, and the **Graduate School of Design & Science (SDS)**.

### Chiba Institute of Technology (Chiba Tech)

The **Chiba Institute of Technology (Chiba Tech)** is the oldest private technology institute in Japan. Established in 1942 as the *Kōa Institute of Technology*—with “Kōa” meaning “Asia wakes up”—the school emerged from a historical moment oriented toward technological advancement and regional ambition.

Today, Chiba Tech balances respect for tradition with forward-looking imagination. Its culture reflects both pride in Japanese heritage and a principled design philosophy oriented toward innovation and experimentation. As Chiba Tech enters a new chapter as a hub for advanced technology education under Joi Ito’s leadership, its evolving identity serves as both a celebration of legacy and an articulation of future ambition.

### Graduate School of Design & Science (SDS)

The **Graduate School of Design & Science (SDS)** is a new graduate school launching in April 2026. SDS brings together engineers, designers, artists, and scientists in a project-based learning environment focused on solving complex, real-world problems.

Core elements of the SDS curriculum include antidisciplinary collaboration, engagement with agentic AI as part of the creative and analytical workflow, and the integration of Japanese aesthetics and cultural context into contemporary technological practice.

### Henkaku Center for Radical Transformation

The **Henkaku Center for Radical Transformation** is a research center within Chiba Tech that provides shared infrastructure and connective tissue across education, research, and policy initiatives.

The Center supports experimental programs, institutional prototyping, and cross-cutting initiatives—such as the Henkaku Compass Initiative—that explore new models of coordination, governance, and social impact.

### Henkaku Compass Initiative

Based in Henkaku Center, The **Henkaku Compass Initiative** is an umbrella effort to design and experiment with **radical coordination technology** — tools, frameworks, and practices that help groups align, make decisions, and evolve together without defaulting to rigid hierarchy or static rules.

The Initiative explores questions such as:

- How can institutions maintain coherence while remaining adaptive?
- How can shared values be encoded without over‑prescription?
- How can governance processes remain transparent, legible, and participatory at scale?

Within this context, the Charter serves as both:
- A concrete institutional artifact, and
- A prototype for how foundational documents themselves can be collaboratively governed.

While these institutions provide the originating context and ongoing stewardship, the Charter itself is intended to be reusable, adaptable, and extensible across other organizational and institutional settings.

## Project Status and Maturity

This project is intentionally evolving. Some structures and processes described here may be aspirational or under active development. The Charter itself should be treated as authoritative regarding values and intent, even as its form and governance mechanisms continue to mature.
