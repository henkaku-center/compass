# Charter Platform Progress Update

**Last Updated: February 4, 2026**

Since our January meeting, we've made substantial progress on building the Charter as a living document:

## What We've Accomplished

**Charter Structure**
- Created a clear template showing what belongs in each section
- Completed the 12 foundational principles (in English and Japanese)
- Organized the Charter into 8 main sections (recently split Research and Educational Practice into separate sections)
- Added guidance notes throughout explaining what content should go in each part

**Project Definition System**
- Added a new Charter section requiring organizations to track their projects
- Created a template that helps people define projects clearly by answering:
  - What problem are you addressing?
  - What will you build or change?
  - How will you know if you succeeded?
  - What would make this project complete?

**Website for Viewing Documents**
- Built a simple website where people can read the Charter
- Made the guidance notes visible (they show up in light gray)
- Added the project template to the website
- Organized files so it's easy to find what you need
- Added direct linking - can share URLs that go straight to specific pages
- Added social media preview cards for sharing on Twitter, Facebook, etc.

**Consensus Mechanism Design**
- Drafted user stories describing how people will interact with the Charter
- Designed data structure for tracking proposals, reviews, and decisions
- Laid groundwork for formal approval process

**Documentation**
- Updated the overview to explain how everything is organized
- Created instructions for people helping with this work
- Documented how we track changes over time
- Added this status page to track progress for non-technical stakeholders
- Comprehensive guide for AI assistants working on this project

## What Still Needs Work

**Decision-Making Process**
- Data structure and user stories drafted, but system not yet implemented
- Need to build the actual tools for submitting, reviewing, and approving changes
- Need to finalize: approval thresholds, reviewer requirements, voting mechanisms

**Charter Content**
- The 12 principles are done, but most other sections are still empty
- Each section has notes explaining what should go there—now we need to write the actual content

**Project Registry Platform**
- We have the template for how to describe projects
- We don't yet have a place where people can actually submit and browse projects
- Could be as simple as a spreadsheet or as complex as custom software

## Questions to Discuss

1. **How should we make decisions?** Do we need a formal voting system, or can we keep it simple with reviews and discussions?

2. **What content comes next?** Which Charter sections should we write first? The "Values and Commitments" section has clear guidance and might be a good starting point.

3. **Where do projects live?** Should we use something like Google Sheets, Airtable, or build something custom for people to submit and view projects?

4. **What's the timeline?** The structure is ready—when do we want different sections completed?

The Charter is now set up so multiple people can contribute to different sections at the same time, while keeping everything consistent.

## Reference: Original Planning (January 2026)

From our January meeting, the tasks were:
- Finalize the consensus mechanism
- Finalize the charter content (second draft)
- Finalize list of design specifications for the charter platform
- Identify supporting tools for implementation

Note: "finalize" meant having a first pass ready. The charter platform is designed for revision and updating over time as context changes.
