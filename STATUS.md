# Charter Platform Progress Update

**Last Updated: February 4, 2026** (updated late evening)

Since our January meeting, we've made substantial progress on building the Charter as a living document:

## What We've Accomplished

**Charter Structure**
- Created a clear template showing what belongs in each section
- Completed the 12 foundational principles (in English and Japanese)
- Organized the Charter into 8 main sections (recently split Research and Educational Practice into separate sections)
- Added guidance notes throughout explaining what content should go in each part

**Charter Content Development**
- Drafted comprehensive AI pedagogy framework for Educational Practice section
- Two-pillar approach: Teaching AI (workflow literacy) and Teaching with AI (developing human judgment)
- Emphasizes problem posing over problem solving
- Assessment focuses on judgment and questions, not just answers
- Based on "Teaching AI and Teaching with AI" by Gal Raz & Joseph Austerweil
- Added Roles and Positions section defining categories of people in the ecosystem: Director, Faculty, Principal Researchers, Researchers, Staff, Visiting Researchers, and Affiliates
- Clarified that faculty simultaneously function as principal researchers, reflecting integration of education and research
- Added physical presence expectations: in-person activities should primarily be at Tsudanuma Campus, with off-campus/remote permissible when justified
- Added neurodiversity commitment: respect for different modes of thinking, feeling, and collaborating; emphasis on making implicit expectations explicit so people don't have to guess at unstated rules
- Added human flourishing as explicit aim of transformation (Section II.2)
- Added awareness practices and contemplative traditions as educational resources (Section II.6)
- Added vocational orientation and unity of function/design principles (Section IV.2)
- Added curriculum agility requirement—programs must iterate with AI advances (Section IV.3)
- Added metacognitive development—learning to recognize AI failures (Section IV.3)
- Added industry integration model with joint supervision expectations (Section V.5)
- Added "Resisting Reduction" principle—embracing complexity, questioning quantification (Section II.4)
- Added "Data Humanism" research methodology—warm data, context, human fingerprints on data (Section III.1)
- Added "Non-Antagonistic Engagement"—future-oriented optimism, invitation over coercion (Section VI.3)
- Added "Process as Content"—visible craft, kintsugi principle, tacit knowledge (Section IV.2)
- Added "Balancing Dichotomies"—six productive tensions defining institutional character (Section I)
- Added "Uniqueness" principle—if someone else can do it, we shouldn't (Section III.1)
- Added "Bias Toward Action"—the art of getting things done (Section IV.2)
- Added "Magic"—valuing what escapes measurement (Section II.4)

**Major Content Completion (February 4, 2026 - late)**
- Converted 14 placeholder sections to full Charter text:
  - Preamble: scope, applicability, what Charter is not, living document nature
  - II.1 Antidisciplinarity: definition, distinction from inter/transdisciplinary
  - II.3 Human and AI: agency, accountability, agentic workflows, oversight
  - II.5 Experimentation and Risk: legitimacy of failure, boundaries
  - II.7 Openness with Discernment: when transparency vs. confidentiality
  - II.8 Human Primacy: authority, accountability, legitimacy as human
  - II.9 Coordination as Design Problem: failure modes to avoid
  - IV.1 Project-Centered Learning: projects as learning unit, student agency
  - V.2 Chiba Tech: host institution framing, operating within constraints
  - V.3 Henkaku/SDS: distinct but coupled entities, different functions
  - V.4 Boundary Management: context-dependent roles, authority transfer
  - VI.1 Charter Stewardship: who proposes changes, review process
  - VII.1 Living Nature: versioning, revision conditions, deprecation
  - VII.2 Portability and Reuse: forking vs adoption, derivative obligations

**Project Definition System**
- Added a new Charter section requiring organizations to track their projects
- Created a template that helps people define projects clearly by answering:
  - What problem are you addressing?
  - What will you build or change?
  - How will you know if you succeeded?
  - What would make this project complete?

**Website for Viewing Documents**
- Built a simple website where people can read the Charter
- Made the guidance notes visible (they show up in light gray)
- Added the project template to the website
- Organized files so it's easy to find what you need
- Added direct linking - can share URLs that go straight to specific pages
- Added social media preview cards for sharing on Twitter, Facebook, etc.

**Consensus Mechanism Design**
- Drafted user stories describing how people will interact with the Charter
- Designed data structure for tracking proposals, reviews, and decisions
- Laid groundwork for formal approval process

**Documentation**
- Updated the overview to explain how everything is organized
- Created instructions for people helping with this work
- Documented how we track changes over time
- Added this status page to track progress for non-technical stakeholders
- Comprehensive guide for AI assistants working on this project

## What Still Needs Work

**Decision-Making Process**
- Data structure and user stories drafted, but system not yet implemented
- Need to build the actual tools for submitting, reviewing, and approving changes
- Need to finalize: approval thresholds, reviewer requirements, voting mechanisms

**Charter Content**
- The 12 principles are complete
- Educational Practice section now has substantial content on AI pedagogy
- Most other sections still have guidance notes but need content written
- Priority sections: Research Practice, Values and Commitments, Institutional Relationships

**Project Registry Platform**
- We have the template for how to describe projects
- We don't yet have a place where people can actually submit and browse projects
- Could be as simple as a spreadsheet or as complex as custom software

## Questions to Discuss

1. **How should we make decisions?** Do we need a formal voting system, or can we keep it simple with reviews and discussions?

2. **What content comes next?** Which Charter sections should we write first? The "Values and Commitments" section has clear guidance and might be a good starting point.

3. **Where do projects live?** Should we use something like Google Sheets, Airtable, or build something custom for people to submit and view projects?

4. **What's the timeline?** The structure is ready—when do we want different sections completed?

The Charter is now set up so multiple people can contribute to different sections at the same time, while keeping everything consistent.

## Reference: Original Planning (January 2026)

From our January meeting, the tasks were:
- Finalize the consensus mechanism
- Finalize the charter content (second draft)
- Finalize list of design specifications for the charter platform
- Identify supporting tools for implementation

Note: "finalize" meant having a first pass ready. The charter platform is designed for revision and updating over time as context changes.
