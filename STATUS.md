# Compass Progress Update

**Last Updated: February 5, 2026**

## Current Status

**The Charter draft is complete and ready for review by the Director and founding faculty.**

## What We've Built

### Charter Document

The Charter is organized into 8 sections plus Preamble and Appendices. All sections now contain full text—no placeholders remain.

**Structure:**
- **Preamble** — Scope and applicability
- **I. Foundational Orientations** — 12 directional principles (resilience over strength, systems over objects, etc.) plus 6 balancing dichotomies
- **II. Values and Commitments** — 10 subsections: antidisciplinarity, transformation, human-AI collaboration, complexity, intellectual integrity, experimentation, neurodiversity, cultural identity, openness, coordination
- **III. Research Practice** — Project-centered inquiry, registry infrastructure
- **IV. Educational Practice** — Project-centered learning, learning through making, AI pedagogy
- **V. Institutional Relationships** — Roles, Chiba Tech, Henkaku/SDS, external partners
- **VI. Governance** — Charter stewardship, decision-making, conflict resolution
- **VII. Evolution** — Living document nature, portability
- **VIII. Closing Provisions** — Authority, interpretation, ratification

**Key content includes:**
- AI pedagogy framework (teaching AI literacy + developing human judgment)
- Defined roles: Director, Faculty, Principal Researchers, Researchers, Staff, Visiting Researchers, Affiliates
- Japanese cultural concepts integrated (*wa*, *ma*, *wabi-sabi*, *monozukuri*)
- Neurodiversity commitment with explicit expectations
- Distinction between "projects" (bounded, with completion criteria) and "initiatives" (ongoing programs)

### Curriculum Documentation

Documented SDS Master's (30 credits) and PhD (17 credits) programs, mapped to Charter principles.

### Registry Schema

Created a unified schema for tracking people, projects, and initiatives across institutions. The three parts cross-reference each other for network visibility.

### Website

Built a viewer at [compass.henkaku.org](https://compass.henkaku.org) with:
- Navigation across all documents (Home, Status, Charter, Curriculum, Registry Schema, References)
- Table of contents sidebar with scroll tracking
- Collapsible sections
- References page for source documents
- Direct linking to specific pages

## What Still Needs Work

1. **Charter Review and Ratification** — The draft needs review by the Director and seven founding faculty before ratification

2. **Amendment System** — A process for proposing and reviewing changes after ratification (data structure drafted, not yet implemented)

3. **Registry Platform** — We have the schema but need a place to actually submit and browse entries (could be a spreadsheet or custom software)

## Questions to Discuss

1. **Review process** — How should ratifying members review and comment on the draft?

2. **Amendment workflow** — How should people propose changes after ratification?

3. **Registry platform** — Google Sheets, Airtable, or custom software?

4. **Timeline** — When do we aim to ratify?

## Reference: Original Planning (January 2026)

From our January meeting:
- Finalize consensus mechanism
- Finalize charter content (second draft)
- Finalize design specifications for the platform
- Identify supporting tools

Note: "finalize" meant having a first pass ready. The platform is designed for ongoing revision.
