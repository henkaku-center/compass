# Compass Progress Update

**Last Updated: February 6, 2026**

## Current Status

**The Charter draft is complete and ready for review by the Director and founding faculty.**

## What We've Built

### Charter

The Charter articulates the values, principles, and governance commitments shared across Henkaku Center, SDS, and Chiba Tech. It is organized into 9 sections:

- **Preamble** — Scope and applicability
- **I. Foundational Orientations** — 12 directional principles (resilience over strength, systems over objects, etc.)
- **II. Values and Commitments** — Antidisciplinarity, human-AI collaboration, intellectual integrity, cultural identity, and more
- **III. Research Practice** — Project-centered inquiry
- **IV. Educational Practice** — Project-centered learning, learning through making, AI pedagogy
- **V. Registry and Coordination Infrastructure** — Shared platform for tracking people, projects, initiatives, courses, theses, and events
- **VI. Institutional Relationships** — Roles, Chiba Tech, Henkaku/SDS, external partners
- **VII. Governance** — Charter stewardship, decision-making, conflict resolution
- **VIII. Evolution** — Living document nature, portability
- **IX. Closing Provisions** — Authority, interpretation, ratification

All sections contain full text — no placeholders remain.

### Archetypes

The Archetypes document defines structural templates for six types of registry entries:

- **People** — Roles, expertise, affiliations, and project involvement
- **Projects** — Bounded endeavors with completion criteria
- **Initiatives** — Ongoing programs evaluated on continuing justification
- **Courses** — Educational units with learning objectives and Charter alignment
- **Theses** — Student research with advisors, committees, and defense milestones
- **Events** — Gatherings that connect people and advance work

These templates cross-reference each other, so a person links to their projects, a thesis links to its advisor, and a course links to the Charter principles it embodies.

### Curriculum

Documented SDS Master's (30 credits) and PhD (17 credits) programs, mapped to Charter principles.

### Website

Built a viewer at [compass.henkaku.org](https://compass.henkaku.org) with navigation, table of contents, collapsible sections, a references page, a history page, and a landing page organized into two layers:

- **DNA** — Foundational documents (Charter, Archetypes)
- **Emergent** — Living content that grows from the DNA (Curriculum, with placeholders for future People, Projects, Initiatives, Theses, and Events directories)

The landing page features an animated compass icon and a rotator that cycles through the 12 Foundational Orientations. A dedicated History page shows the project's commit history pulled live from GitHub in a three-column table: contributor, type, and memo.

### Agentic Development

Compass is developed using LLM coding agents — AI tools that draft, edit, and coordinate document changes under human direction. This is a deliberate practice that informs how contribution workflows are designed.

The agentic approach spans three dimensions: development with agents, agent-assisted contribution by participants, and planned agentic interfaces (such as chat bots) that will let contributors propose changes without needing direct repository access.

## What Still Needs Work

1. **Charter Review and Ratification** — The draft needs review by the Director and founding faculty before ratification

2. **Amendment System** — A process for proposing and reviewing changes after ratification

3. **Registry Platform** — The Archetypes define the structure; we still need a platform where people can actually submit and browse entries (could be a spreadsheet, database, or custom software)

4. **Agentic Contribution Interfaces** — Tools (such as chat bots or Slack integrations) that let contributors propose changes without needing direct access to the repository

## Questions to Discuss

1. **Review process** — How should ratifying members review and comment on the draft?

2. **Amendment workflow** — How should people propose changes after ratification?

3. **Registry platform** — What platform should host actual entries? Google Sheets, Airtable, or custom software?

4. **Timeline** — When do we aim to ratify?

5. **Agentic contribution pathways** — What interfaces (Slack bots, web forms, coding agents) should contributors use to propose changes?

## Reference: Original Planning (January 2026)

From our January meeting:
- Finalize consensus mechanism
- Finalize charter content (second draft)
- Finalize design specifications for the platform
- Identify supporting tools

Note: "finalize" meant having a first pass ready. The platform is designed for ongoing revision.
