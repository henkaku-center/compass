# Compass Progress Update

**Last Updated: February 12, 2026**

## Current Status

**The initial Charter draft is complete. A mechanism for faculty submissions and voting on future updates is being developed at [charter.henkaku.center](https://charter.henkaku.center). The Compass website and registry are live with very rough populated data across six of eight entry types. This data is extremely tentative.**

## What's In Place

### Charter

The Charter articulates shared values, principles, and governance commitments across Henkaku Center, SDS, and Chiba Tech. It lives at [charter.henkaku.center](https://charter.henkaku.center) in 9 sections covering foundational orientations, values, research and educational practice, registry infrastructure, institutional relationships, governance, and evolution. The initial draft is complete — no placeholders remain. The mechanism for future amendments via faculty submissions and voting is being developed at the same site.

### Archetypes

Structural templates for eight registry entry types: People, Projects, Initiatives, Institutions, Courses, Events, Theses, and Posts. These templates define what information each type carries and how entries cross-reference each other.

### Registry

Six entry types are populated with real data:

| Type | Count | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| People | 62 | With portrait photos, affiliations, expertise, and project links |
| Initiatives | 9 | Ongoing programs like Probabilistic Computing, Artificial Life, AI Safety Workshop |
| Institutions | 6 | Chiba Tech, Henkaku Center, SDS, plus partners JPCCA, ALife Institute, AISI |
| Projects | 3 | Compass, SDS Launch, Antidisciplinary Charter |
| Courses | 25 | All Master's and PhD courses extracted from the Curriculum |
| Events | 1 | Symposium of Design and Science 2025 (July 5, Shibuya) |

Two types remain as placeholders: **Theses** and **Posts**. All registry data is tentative and needs to be reviewed for accuracy.

### Curriculum

The SDS Master's (30 credits) and PhD (17 credits) programs are documented, with each course mapped to Charter principles. The 25 individual courses are also available as browsable registry entries.

### Website

The viewer at [compass.henkaku.center](https://compass.henkaku.center) includes:

- **Landing page** organized into DNA (Charter, Archetypes) and Emergent (registry, curriculum, network) layers, with an animated compass icon and orientation rotator
- **Sidebar navigation** across all pages showing the full site map
- **Registry pages** for People, Projects, Initiatives, Institutions, Courses, and Events with expandable cards showing full details
- **Network visualization** — an interactive 3D graph showing relationships between all registry entries, color-coded by type
- **Curriculum page** rendering the full program structure with course tables
- **History page** showing the project's commit history pulled live from GitHub
- **References page** linking to foundational source documents
- **Login and inline editing** via GitHub personal access token, with structured forms for editing or creating registry entries
- **Feedback page** for submitting bug reports and feature requests

### Partner Institutions

Three external partners are now linked to the ecosystem:

- **JPCCA** (Japan Probabilistic Computing Association) — hosts the Probabilistic Computing initiative
- **ALife Institute** (Artificial Life Institute, Kyoto) — hosts the Artificial Life initiative
- **AISI** (Japan AI Safety Institute) — hosts the AI Safety Workshop initiative

### Agentic Development

Compass is developed using LLM coding agents under human direction. This is deliberate practice that informs how contribution workflows are designed, spanning three dimensions: development with agents, agent-assisted contribution, and planned agentic interfaces for contributors without direct repository access.

## What Still Needs Work

1. **Charter Amendment System** — A mechanism for faculty to submit, discuss, and vote on Charter updates is being developed at [charter.henkaku.center](https://charter.henkaku.center)
3. **Remaining Registry Types** — Theses and Posts are defined in the Archetypes but not yet populated
4. **Agentic Contribution Interfaces** — Tools (chat bots, Slack integrations) for contributors without direct repository access
