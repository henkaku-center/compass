## I. Statement of Founding Precepts

We set forth the following principles, process, and areas of practice, which the School of Design & Science commits to uphold in perpetuity. These precepts embody the founding vision of the School.

### Principles

**RESILIENCE over strength.**  
強さではなく、しなやかさを持つ。

**SYSTEMS over objects.**  
モノではなく、システムに焦点を合わせる。

**DISOBEDIENCE over compliance.**  
服従ではなく、反抗する。

**PULL over push.**  
「押す」のではなく、「引く」。

**COMPASSES over maps.**  
地図ではなく、良いコンパスを持つ。

**EMERGENCE over authority.**  
専門家ではなく、クラウド（人々）に向かう。

**RISK over safety.**  
安全ではなく、リスクを取る。

**PRACTICE over theory.**  
理論ではなく、実践に基づく。

**LEARNING over education.**  
教育ではなく、学びに焦点を当てる。

**SUSTAINABILITY over growth.**  
拡大ではなく、持続可能性。

**PUBLIC over individuals.**  
個人の利益ではなく、公共的な視点を持つこと。

**MODULAR over monolithic.**  
一枚岩ではなく、モジュール型のデザインを意識すること。

### Process

Rather than a top-down approach where leaders determine values and priorities, or a purely bottom-up approach where methods emerge from hands-on experience, SDS employs three guiding principles¹: identifying and eliminating waste (無駄, *Muda*), managing unevenness (斑, *Mura*), and preventing overburden (無理, *Muri*). We prioritize collaborative structures involving students, faculty, researchers, and administrators alike which address these three factors as core optimization variables to surface issues early and maintain a lean operation. This approach aligns with our commitment to maintain SDS as an inclusive yet elite organization.

### Domains of Creative Exploration

SDS explores four domains of creative exploration: **Science, Engineering, Design, and Art**. These domains exist in an entangled cycle of exchange². Science explains and predicts the world, converting information into knowledge. Engineering applies that knowledge to develop solutions, converting knowledge into utility. Design embodies solutions that maximize function and experience, converting utility into behavior. Art questions behavior and creates awareness, converting behavior into new perceptions of information, completing the cycle. 

We engage these four domains not by training specialists in each, but by cultivating the capacity to traverse and transcend between them. With sufficient energy, achieved through excellence and deep integration, practitioners can leap directly between domains, bypassing sequential progression. Rather than wearing four separate hats, we provide one pair of shoes for the journey. Each realm can incite revolution within another. We seek to redefine expertise itself.

## II. An Antidisciplinary Institution

What differentiates SDS is not its focus on any particular domain, but its commitment to antidisciplinary³ culture as a method for systemic impact. We pursue the highest leverage by identifying the complex systems we inhabit and intervening at their most powerful point: the paradigms that structure them.

Traditional disciplinary boundaries cannot address our generation’s defining challenges, from climate change and social polarization to technological disruption and more. These problems, as well as their opportunities, emerge from entrenched paradigms which demand new approaches that transcend existing frameworks. Antidisciplinary work is our response to this necessity.

Paradigms shape systems across multiple perspectives⁴. From the scientific lens, Thomas Kuhn defined a paradigm as the set of common beliefs and agreements shared between scientists about how problems should be understood and addressed⁵. The shift from Newtonian mechanics to Einstein’s relativity didn’t just solve problems differently; it redefined what the problems were. From systems dynamics, Donella Meadows describes the paradigm as “that out of which the system—its goals, power structure, rules, its culture—arises.”⁶ Whether a society operates under capitalism or socialism generates fundamentally different goals, rules, and culture. From evolutionary dynamics, Martin Nowak shows how paradigms determine the unit of payout (what gets measured and rewarded), which then enforces structure⁷. In evolutionary games, a well-mixed population versus spatially structured interactions changes the fitness unit from individual accumulation to neighborhood-level cooperation, fundamentally altering which structures can survive.

Paradigms can be transcended and altered; however, we are always operating within some paradigm. The work lies in identifying which paradigm shapes our system, then intervening deliberately. We can intervene by adjusting flows, feedback, goals, rules, and connections, but the highest-leverage intervention is shifting to a new paradigm.

The connection between antidisciplinary work and paradigm shifts is nearly definitional. Current paradigms created our disciplinary organization; transcending paradigms requires transcending these boundaries.

Interdisciplinary work has succeeded in creating fields like bioengineering, but it is no longer sufficient. As cross-cutting forces like computation accelerate, traditional disciplines cannot evolve fast enough. Antidisciplinary culture provides the speed and flexibility to match the pace of change.

This paradigm-transcending work already manifests across our faculty.

Professors Mizuki Oka and Hiroki Kojima study Artificial Life, challenging the pure optimization and convergence approach dominant in AI today. Professor Joe Austerweil develops probabilistic computing approaches that embrace uncertainty and stochasticity. New paradigms require new tools.

Professors Oka and Kojima’s work also reframes how we measure progress, valuing exploration and novelty over convergence. Director Joi Ito and Professor Daum Kim collaborate on the design of a new special jurisdiction in Bhutan, applying evolutionary dynamics to governance itself.

Professors Ira Winder and Catharina Maracke reimagine cooperation through incentive structures, computational platforms, and law. Catharina’s work on Creative Commons reframes knowledge from scarcity to shared commons, shifting cooperation from permission-seeking to default sharing with conditions.

We describe ourselves as antidisciplinary to signal two commitments: (1) SDS members bring disciplinary traditions while having experience moving beyond them; and (2) we transcend disciplines through collaboration, producing fundamentally new outputs.

Outputs may include artwork, startups, legal frameworks, digital platforms, and institutions, spanning timescales from speculative to near-term intervention.

## III. Degree Requirements

### Learning at SDS

SDS is taught entirely in English and is open to students from any background. We do not believe in one-size-fits-all pathways.

All major projects culminate in public artifacts or applied contributions. Evaluation incorporates feedback from faculty and students alike.

Students work with faculty as partners in inquiry. Each student is assigned an advisor, who meets regularly with the student and submits a written report each semester.
