Sophia is an engineer, institution-builder, and policy analyst. She creates structures that enable the production of technological public goods. At Henkaku, Sophia is developing coordination technology and legal frameworks for new jurisdictions with the Coordination Technology Consortium and the Laboratory for Global Systems and Public Policy.

Sophia began her work in complex systems as an aerospace engineer at NASA, building for exoplanet detection missions, Mars Sample Return, and the first demonstrations towards self-assembly in space. The rigorous environment drives her experiment-based, first-principles approach to systems design, which she has since introduced to national technology policy and emerging market analysis. Sophia is a global ambassador for the [Fab Foundation](https://fabfoundation.org/), a network of 2,500+ community digital fabrication labs worldwide. In this role, she develops creative prototyping tools which have proliferated globally, from Barcelona to Bhutan. In her personal life, she studies food systems as a chef and agricultural technologist.
