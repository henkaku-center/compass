Aya is the President of the Ethereum Foundation, where she stewards both the vision and the soul of Ethereum, keeping its technology and values in dialogue as the ecosystem grows across cultures and continents. The Foundation supports Ethereum’s long-term health through core protocol research, development, ecosystem resources, and by fostering education and community building worldwide.

From 2018 to 2025, Aya served as the Foundation’s Executive Director, where she seeded the Infinite Garden vision, a metaphor and guiding philosophy for Ethereum as an open, permissionless, and evolving ecosystem. This vision took root through initiatives that connected communities across Latin America, Southeast Asia, Africa, and beyond. Under her leadership, the Foundation upheld decentralization across all aspects of the ecosystem and supported work in programmable cryptography, including zero-knowledge proofs, as well as efforts linking Ethereum with public sector, academic, and grassroots communities.

Today, Aya continues to tend the Infinite Garden, reaching beyond Ethereum’s borders to explore what a truly decentralized creative space could be: open-source, inclusive, and permissionless, where code and human stories grow side by side.
