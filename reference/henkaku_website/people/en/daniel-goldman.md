[Daniel Goldman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielgoldman) is a technologist and systems-oriented designer focused on building IT and interpersonal systems that help people navigate complexity and business viability.

Daniel studied Physics and Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley, pausing his studies to work with Will Wright at Maxis as the senior developer on the hit simulation game SimCity and related titles (including SimAnt, SimEarth, and SimLife) while leading and building Total Entertainment Network, the first internet entertainment company.

After completing his computer science degree, Daniel pursued graduate study in cognitive neuroscience at Columbia University, deepening his understanding of narrative, decision-making, and human development.  He went on to serve as COO and Chief Product Officer at Posit Science, where he built software-based cognitive rehabilitation for older adults and collaborated with leading neuroscientists worldwide.

Over time, Daniel’s work broadened from products to ecosystems: angel investing, board leadership, mentoring, interviewing over 200 social entrepreneurs, and using that experience to co-design and co-launch leadership and venture-building initiatives, including Future Champions; EDGEof, the Game Changer’s Studio in Tokyo with Taizo Son; the Hult Prize counsel with international impact entrepreneurs; Prosperity Exchange, supporting smallholder farmers at scale; Prosper Hall and Exceptional School initiatives, expanding pathways for learners who do not thrive in traditional education; and the Planetary Insight Center, a collaborative experiential simulation initiative in collaboration with NEC where he was a futurist.

For larger systems he looks towards simulations, community building and immersive experiences that reduce cognitive load, improve stakeholder alignment, understanding and perspective-taking.

As a visiting scholar, Daniel’s research centers on real world systems-oriented solutions for scalable impact and working with private and public organizations to implement transformative changes as well as to help startups get from zero to one.  

His driving questions: How do we  design of our systems so the outcomes are emerge organically? How do we gather feedback and tune our systems when the outcomes diverge from our goals?  He applies this work through his consulting work with [TRAMS.Tokyo](mailto:info@trams.tokyo)

Daniel is co-author on patents for cognitive rehabilitation using game-like software, emotional communications in virtual spaces, and using social network identity to create virtual avatars.
