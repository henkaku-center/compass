Her first book, [Small Arcs of Larger Circles](https://www.triarchypress.net/small-arcs.html) is a revolutionary personal approach to the study of systems and complexity.

In her latest second book [Combining](https://www.combining.life/), Nora invites us into an ecology of communication where nothing stands alone, and every action sets off a chain of incalculable consequences. She challenges conventional fixes for our problems, highlighting the need to tackle issues at multiple levels, understand interdependence, and embrace ambiguity.
