My research explores interactions of randomness and computation, and focuses on the foundations of probabilistic computing, efficient samplers and testing methods for probabilistic inference, and the mathematics of random structures.

I am currently a Research Scientist in the MIT [Probabilistic Computing Project](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/) and a Project Associate Professor in the Keio University SFC [Graduate School of Media and Governance](https://www.sfc.keio.ac.jp/gsmg/en/). Previously at MIT I was an Instructor in [Pure Mathematics](http://math.mit.edu/research/pure/) 2008–2010, a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](http://www.csail.mit.edu/) 2011–2013, and a Postdoctoral Associate in the [Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences](http://bcs.mit.edu/) 2013–2015. I was a Junior Researcher in the [Mathematics Department](http://math.hawaii.edu/) of the University of Hawaii at Manoa 2010–2011, a Lyric Labs Visiting Fellow at [Analog Devices](http://www.analog.com/) 2013–2014, a Research Scientist at [Gamalon Labs](http://gamalon.com/) 2013–2016, and Chief Scientist at [Remine](http://remine.com/) 2017–2018.
