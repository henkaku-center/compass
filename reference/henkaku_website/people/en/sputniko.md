Hiromi Ozaki, known as Sputniko!, is a British–Japanese artist whose work playfully yet provocatively explores the intersection of technology, identity, and society. Through films, robotics, music, and interactive installations, she challenges social norms and imagines the ethical and cultural implications of emerging technologies.

Her work has been exhibited internationally at leading institutions, including MoMA (New York), Centre Pompidou-Metz (France), the V&A Museum (London), Cooper Hewitt (New York), the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art (Kanazawa), and the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo. Between 2013 and 2017, she was an Assistant Professor at the MIT Media Lab, where she founded and directed the Design Fiction Group, and later served as Associate Professor at both the University of Tokyo and Tokyo University of the Arts.

Named Vogue Japan Woman of the Year in 2013, Sputniko! has also been recognized as a TED Fellow, delivering a widely acclaimed talk at TED 2019, and as a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader in 2017. Her works are held in significant permanent collections, including M+ (Hong Kong), the Victoria and Albert Museum (UK), and the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art (Japan).

In recent years, she has expanded her practice into social entrepreneurship as Founder and CEO of Cradle Inc., a company dedicated to supporting women’s health and well-being in the workplace, now serving more than 80 major corporations across Japan.
