Hiroki Kojima, Ph.D. (Physics), is a complex‑systems scientist who investigates how information dynamics at biological, artificial, and social interfaces give rise to adaptive behavior and cognition.

His research ranges from quantitative studies of human dyadic interaction and cognitive‑map formation in generative neural networks, to unifying the continuous cellular automaton Lenia with reaction–diffusion physics, building ALife–BLife hybrid systems, and analyzing the collective behavior of the ciliate Tetrahymena. Each project combines fine‑grained behavioral data, information‑theoretic metrics, and computational modeling to expose the self‑organizing dynamics that emerge at interfaces.

He began his research career as a Research Fellow at the University of Tokyo in 2018. He then joined Alternative Machine Inc. as a Senior Researcher, and since 2021 has held a Project Researcher post in computational psychiatry at the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry. 

He seeks to clarify the principles by which life and cognition co‑emerge through information dynamics—linking microbes, minds, and machines—and to design systems in which artificial and biological life together realize new forms of being.
