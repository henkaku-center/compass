Grisha Szep is a Researcher at the Henkaku Center, where he works on probabilistic computing, AI-integrated healthcare and educational systems. He collaborates with open-endedness research teams at the Artificial Life Institute in Kyoto. Grisha has a passion for building visually stunning tools and leveraging GPU-accelerated computing for solving complex problems.

With over a decade of experience across biomedical research, AI and the software industry, Grisha's contributions range across several disciplines including quantum computing, immunology, synthetic and developmental biology. During his PhD fellowship at Microsoft Research Cambridge he developed an expertise in geometric deep learning for synthetic biology and built software for high-dimensional single-cell cytometry and multi-omics analysis. Grisha is strongly motivated by, and pursues collaborations with experimental biologists. He proudly remembers building cytoskeletal simulations at Sixt Group at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria, side-by-side with experimentalists collecting electron microscopy images.                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                 
A running theme throughout his research has been the importance of active learning and data flywheels. Tight feedback loops between hypothesis generation and validation against observations becomes increasingly important in the era of long-running agentic workflows. His most recent passion is to empower undergraduate engineers and educators at the School of Design and Science (SDS) with these workflows, lower the financial entry barrier to parallelisable productivity. With is experience working for start-ups in London and across Europe, he is committed to support young leaders in start-up ventures.
