I am a cognitive scientist, who recently completed his PhD in Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT, where I primarily studied visual attention and developed tools for high-throughput behavioral experiments. Before that, I studied numerical cognition as a MSc researcher at the University of Oxford. I am also interested in first-person study of the mind, and practice Vipassana meditation.

Nowadays, I strive to contribute to the educational and economic development of Bhutan. At the same time, I aim to promote Bhutan's commitment to happiness and mindfulness, with the hope that these values will spread throughout the rest of the world.
