I am a Research Scientist at [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/) [Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/) where I work with [Joi Ito](https://joi.ito.com/) on cryptocurrencies (at the [Digital Currency Initiative](https://dci.mit.edu/)) and Ethics of Artificial Intelligence (at the [Ethics Initiative](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/ethics/overview/)).

I co-invented [Zerocash](http://zerocash-project.org/) and co-founded [Zcash](https://z.cash/). Both of these rely on *[libsnark](https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark)*, the efficient C++ library for zero-knowledge proofs, that I am an author of.

I recently graduated with Ph.D. in Computer Science from MIT, where I was fortunate to be advised by incomparable [Ron Rivest](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/). My [Ph.D. thesis](https://madars.org/phd-thesis/), also on *libsnark*, won the [George M. Sprowls Award](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/news-events/announcements/eecs-presents-awards-outstanding-phd-and-sm-theses-0) for Best MIT Ph.D. Thesis in Computer Science. Before coming to MIT I did my undergraduate work at [University of Latvia](https://www.lu.lv/eng/) under the excellent guidance of [Andris Ambainis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andris_Ambainis).
