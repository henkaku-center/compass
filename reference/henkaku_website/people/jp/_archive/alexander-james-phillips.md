Alexander James Phillips believes that the world is an increasingly complex and uncertain place, and to understand it we need to improve our individual and collective sense making abilities. AJP is a researcher, biochemist and software engineer working with CCI to build tools that help us make sense of our complex and uncertain world, and harness our conscious collective intelligence.

Early in the pandemic AJP helped co-found [Helpful Engineering](https://helpfulengineering.org/), the community for crowd sourced anti-covid action, and the [OpenCovidPledge](https://opencovidpledge.org/). Prior to these efforts to help resolve the pandemic sooner, he founded the crowdsourcing wiki simulations platform [TheWorldSim.org](https://theworldsim.org/). AJP has more than 10 years of experience in commercial software development, and holds a masters in biochemistry from the University of Oxford and a masters in biotechnology from the University of Cambridge.
